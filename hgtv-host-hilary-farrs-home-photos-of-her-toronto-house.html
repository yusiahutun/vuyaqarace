The <a href=#>HGTV </a></span><span>star lives in a stunning house in Canada where she was born. She moved into the home in 1996 and has kept a lot of its classic design elements and charm.</span></p><p><span>The British-Canadian designer developed a passion for home renovation, following in the footsteps of her mother who was an avid interior decorator. Hilary was also interested in the arts and began performing in theater at a young age. She moved to Los Angeles and set her sights on snagging roles in film and television. In 1975, she landed a part in the iconic cult classic film </span><i><span>The Rocky Horror Picture Show</span></i><span>.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>“It is an amazing fun fact,” Hilary said in a </span><a href=#><span>January 2020 interview</span></a><span> about her experience in the film. “It came about because we lived — as a family — right below <strong>Tim Curry</strong>.”&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>After pursuing acting through the mid-’80s, the Rules of Renovation cofounder began to focus more on <a href=#>interior design</a>. She landed the hosting role on </span><i><span>Love It or List It </span></i><span>in 2008 alongside cohost </span><b>David Visentin</b><span>. In 2021, Hilary debuted her new <a href=#>HGTV</a> show, </span><i><span>Tough Love With Hilary Farr</span></i><span>, where she uses her design skills to help improve relationships in each home she visits.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>When it came to decorating her own Toronto home, the </span><i><span>Legend of the Werewolf</span></i><span> actress decided on keeping an open floor plan. Her son, Josh, with ex-husband </span><b>Gordon Farr</b><span>, grew up in the house and would bring friends over all the time. Though Hilary travels a lot for work, it’s always very rewarding coming home to her gorgeous open space and getting to relax.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>“It’s an interesting design because it works very well in the world of COVID by chance. I like the concept of open plan but I also like the idea of being able to close those spaces off,” Hilary told </span><a href=#><span>Heavy</span></a><span> about the layout of her home in June 2021. “So, my solution is to not go fully open but make extra-large openings and then use pocket doors. So, you just have a very large opening, with absolute connection between the spaces when the doors are retracted into the walls.”</span></p><p><b>Keep scrolling to take a tour of Hilary’s Toronto home.</b></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLjOrJyrr5WauK3FjZympmegpMC1v46hnq2uXZ28tMCMoaClmaKueqet0auqZqCforJuvMeoq6irXaSzbrTEq2Stp6Kku7W7jKGmrquVZA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 DashJ - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
