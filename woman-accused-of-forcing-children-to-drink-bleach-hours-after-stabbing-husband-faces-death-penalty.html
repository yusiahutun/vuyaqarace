The 3-year-old girl was pronounced dead at the hospital, while the 8-year-old daughter survived. The husband was also treated and survived.</p><p>Osceola County Sheriff Marcos Lopez <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>previously</strong></a> said Zephir told authorities someone "must have put a voodoo spell on her," causing her to harm her kids. She also allegedly told family members she planned to turn herself in over an outstanding warrant for the attack on her husband, but wanted to see her children one final time first.</p><p>"She took both of the children and left the family member's residence. Several hours later, she called a family member and told her she had killed her 3-year-old and the 8-year-old was also going to die and then she would kill herself," Lopez said at the time of the crime.</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:857e6753-0b85-4d14-a77b-b98b1d115794 data-container-ref=toofab:article:37002e41-49eb-489f-8ae3-57cf90c0a42e data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=27><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/56/5by4/2024/04/24/56a745e4ef954c10a9691c8732c8e297_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">Facebook</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">10-Year-Old Boy Calls 9-1-1 After Waking Up to 'Massacre' of Entire Family</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><p>Zephir was also indicted on attempted first degree murder with a weapon and attempted felony murder with a weapon charges.
