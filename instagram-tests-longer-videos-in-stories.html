The development of Stories, which was on the table last month, has finally gone live. This means that video clips which are longer than 15 seconds will no longer be broken into parts and played across multiple Stories frames as they were previously. This innovation was introduced to Instagram users in order to provide them more control over their sharing. With this development,&nbsp;users will be less interrupted while sharing stories.</p><p>Despite the fact that Instagram launched a live test of 60-second video in its Stories, it is only being tested with a limited set of users for the time being. This function is being offered in order to expand the use of Instagram’s numerous video products, as well as to provide its users more freedom. As a result of this development, Instagram will make it easier for its users to create.</p><p>This is a major move and a significant shift for Instagram. Although it’s currently limited, we hope to see longer Stories clips on the app in the near future.</p><p><strong>What do you think about this new feature of Instagram?
