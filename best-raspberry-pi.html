Maybe you want a machine dedicated to learning coding, or a simple and portable PC for any number of robotics projects. In all of these scenarios, the Raspberry Pi 5 would be a fantastic launching point.</p><p>Raspberry Pi is comprised of the core components of a computer—the processor, a GPU, and typically connectors and ports for expandable storage, wired network connections, and audio and visual outputs. Raspberry Pi 5 is the latest generation, with an improved quad-core Cortex-A76 64-bit CPU running at 2.4GHz, an 800MHz VideoCore VII GPU, and M.2 NVME SSD support. Like the Pi 4, the newer model also supports <a href=#>Bluetooth 5.0</a>, dual-band Wi-Fi, and comes stock with two USB 2.0 and two USB 3.0 ports.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>While the Raspberry Pi is made of the base components, if you want to run it at all like a computer, you’ll need to load an operating system, like the Raspberry Pi OS or any other Linux-based OS geared toward your specific goals.</p><p>The OS may give a platform to run your desired program or application, but additional parts are needed to develop a complete system. That’s where a premade kit comes in handy. Typically packed with a power supply, microSD card, motherboard, and heatsinks, the best Raspberry Pi kits on the market are a launching point for something versatile and exciting.</p><p>When shopping for a kit, you need to start with what your intended endgame is. If it’s a makeshift video game console, then a kit with a sizable <a href=#>microSD card</a>, display cords, and a fan to prevent overheating when you’re really immersed in the game would serve you best. If you’re new to Raspberry Pi, then a smaller kit with just the essentials will give you plenty to tinker with.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>For your next DIY miniature home computer, consider any of our Raspberry Pi kit recommendations to simplify your choice.

Where the Pi 5 starts to truly shine is with its processor, which is bumped up to a 64-bit quad-core Cortex-A76 at 2.4GHz, and the GPU, which jumps from 500MHz to 800MHz.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The Raspberry Pi 5 is a little more user-friendly, with an added SSD drive option via HAT (Hardware Attached on Top), dual 4K/60Hz display output, PCIe expansion connector, and a built-in power button.</p><p>There are two versions of the Raspberry Pi 5, one with 4GB of RAM and one with 8GB.

Raspbian OS is the officially supported OS, so it receives the most support when it comes to working on the Raspberry Pi ecosystem. It features some basic tools for programming, but if you stray into other applications, other systems may serve you better. If you're using your Raspberry Pi as a Linux-based media server, you may consider OSMC. Alternatively, RetroPie is an easy-to-use OS for retro gaming.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h3>How do you tell which Raspberry Pi model I have?</h3><p>If you already have an operating system installed, you can run the "cat /sys/firmware/devicetree/base/model" command in the terminal window to display the model number:</p><p>You should also be able to find the model number on the board itself, typically on the front side. If it's not there, you can deduce the Raspberry Pi model by the processor model. For example:</p><ul><li>Processor model 2711 would be on a Raspberry Pi 4/400</li><li>Processor model 2837 would be on a Raspberry Pi 3</li><li>Processor model 2836 would be on a Raspberry Pi 2</li><li>Processor model 2835 would be on a Raspberry Pi 1 or 0</li><li>A processor sporting the Raspberry Pi logo would be on a Raspberry Pi Pico</li></ul><h3>How do you update a Raspberry Pi?</h3><p>On the Raspbian OS, you can use the apt tool to easily update the device. Open the terminal window and type "sudo apt update." If you didn't create a user account, the default password is "raspberry."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>To upgrade every package on the Raspberry Pi, type "sudo apt full-upgrade." The device will start its update and prompt you to reboot once it's completed. To reboot the Raspberry Pi, type "sudo reboot" into the terminal window.</p><h3>Is a Raspberry Pi a computer?</h3><p>Raspberry Pi devices are simple, single-board computers that can run basic applications on a Linux-based system. The concept for the device came about as an affordable means of teaching computer science. Like a computer, the Pi features a processor, a small amount of memory, a video chip, storage or storage options, and sometimes Wi-Fi or Bluetooth connectivity. Because of its simplicity, Raspberry Pi can be turned into a number of things, including retro gaming console emulators, media streaming boxes, and tools to learn programming.</p><h3>How well does Plex run on a Raspberry Pi?</h3><p>While Plex is capable of running on Raspberry Pi devices quite well, RasPlex is a dedicated Plex client built specifically for use on Raspberry Pi computers.
