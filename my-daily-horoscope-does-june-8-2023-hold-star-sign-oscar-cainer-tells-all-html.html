But there’s something else. Although they’re very different in size, they both have a spark of life — an invisible energy that flows through them (and us, too). We might have different physiques to our animal friends, but we’re all created from the same source of primal energy. When we really understand this we’re more in tune with everything. Today, as your awareness increases, so do your chances of success. Change your future!&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span class=mol-style-italic>Call now for your Moon-sign personal forecast.

If you don’t think you need more than you’ve already got, there’s a good chance you’ve got plenty! If not, let’s consider the quantity you think you need. Is it possible you’ve overestimated the scale of a problem? Might the mountain you’re preparing to climb prove to be little more than a molehill once you’ve started? As Pluto prepares to move into Capricorn, there’s a strong indication that you can instigate a major change with very little effort.

But isn’t that the same as telling us not to eat chocolate? It’s easy advice to give, but hard to put into practice. Imagine how boring life would be if we all did everything we were ‘supposed’ to do! How much fun would you have if every detail of your time was accounted for? So, do you need to be honest with yourself today? No! Just be aware of the fact that you might be convincing yourself to do something you don’t really want to do.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span class=mol-style-italic>Big changes are due between now and the next New Moon.

You’re also more conscious of other people’s emotional states, and more likely to understand the reasons behind them. You’re feeling motivated to take on an issue that you previously felt overwhelmed by. It’s still complicated. It’s still messy. And there’s every chance it could go pear-shaped. Yet, with the inner clarity you now possess, you can proceed with confidence. Today you can start taking steps to put right something that’s wrong.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span class=mol-style-italic>Your latest Moon-sign forecast will touch your heart and lift your spirits.

You’ve got to weigh things up and adjust your plans accordingly. Yet if you could stand back and look at everything from afar, you’d be able to see a funny side to your current position.

Just because you’re indecisive doesn’t mean you should put yourself under pressure to make a decision. No. Your uncertainty, in this instance at least, puts you at an advantage.

So is every day. Every hour, minute and second is a gift from the cosmos. The trouble, of course, comes from the challenges we have to deal with.

As Pluto, your ruler, prepares to enter Capricorn, this is a special time. You can find practical ways to realise your dreams and aspirations.

Once it has attached itself to a rock (where it lives without moving), it digests its own nervous system for energy. Which suggests it doesn’t need its brain once it has nowhere to go.

You know what needs to be done, and you’d disappoint yourself (and others) if you didn’t try your best. Which is highly commendable. But we need to talk about ‘trying your best’.
