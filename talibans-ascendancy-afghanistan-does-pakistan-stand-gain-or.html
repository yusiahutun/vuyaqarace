For the Taliban, it was to resist the US presence and eventually force it out of Afghanistan by availing itself of sanctuaries in Pakistan,” he said.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/styles/wide_landscape/public/d8/video/thumbnail/2021/08/18/alkira_afghan_web_clean.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Beyond this marriage of convenience, the relationship between Pakistan and the Taliban had “its own ups and downs, disagreements and divergences”, Basit said.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">For instance, Islamabad was frustrated by the Taliban’s lack of action against the thousands of Pakistani Taliban fighters in eastern Afghanistan, he said.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">At a confidential parliamentary briefing of Pakistan’s politicians on July 2, Inter-Services Intelligence agency chief Lieutenant General Faiz Hameed described the Taliban and the Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) group as “sides of the same coin”.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Likewise, the Taliban has not trusted Pakistan since it sided with Washington in the global war on terror and handed over several Taliban leaders to the US.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Since the US signed a peace agreement with the Taliban in February last year and announced plans to withdraw its military from Afghanistan, the relationship between the Taliban and Islamabad “has been transforming and divergences will increase”, Basit said.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The Taliban resisted pressure from Pakistan’s military leadership against launching a nationwide offensive while Nato forces were still in Afghanistan, and to engage in negotiations with the Kabul government on sharing political power.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-TitleText class="css-66qo9a eeeqn932">Afghanistan debacle will make US courtship of Southeast Asia all the more difficult</span></p></a></h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The Associated Press last month reported that Pakistan’s army chief of staff General Qamar Javed Bajwa was so frustrated by the Taliban’s intransigence that he twice walked out of meetings in Islamabad with its leaders.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">This friction was further evident in early August when the Taliban closed the Chaman-Spin Boldak border crossing with Pakistan to press demands for visa-free cross-border movement of Afghan nationals. The Taliban also threatened to suspend Pakistan’s trade via Afghanistan with Central Asia.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Stanford University analyst Asfandyar Mir said the Pakistan-Taliban relationship, “which has effectively weathered everything the last two decades”, will be further tested now that the Taliban are in power.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Issues of governance, the decades-long border dispute between Afghanistan and Pakistan and the overall foreign policy of the Taliban would be at play, he said.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“The relationship will have more pressure points,” Asfandyar said. “History doesn’t repeat itself, but it tends to rhyme, especially in this region. So I do remember that in the ’90s, after the collapse of the Najibullah government, Pakistan soured on the mujahideen once the power-sharing arrangements lapsed and the civil war intensified.”</p><img

oft-stated diplomatic position that it has no favourites in Afghanistan, Pakistan’s government is clearly comfortable with the return of the Taliban, according to analysts who spoke to This Week in Asia.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Within hours of the fall of Kabul, Pakistan’s Prime Minister Imran Khan said the Afghan people had “broken the shackles of slavery” to the West.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">At least two members of his cabinet mocked the US for its military failure in Afghanistan in social media posts, while the prime minister’s office on Thursday posted a statement reminding the international community that Khan had for 20 years rightfully argued that there was no military solution in Afghanistan, and that negotiated political settlement was the only way forward.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“Pakistan appears to be gearing up to further rehabilitate the Taliban on the international stage,” Asfandyar said.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Islamabad is optimistic that the fall of the Afghan government will deprive ethnic Baloch rebel groups of logistical support for attacks against Pakistani security forces in western Balochistan province, which houses the Chinese-operated port of Gwadar, said Basit from the RSIS.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text

airport</span></p></a></h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Pakistan frequently accused the Kabul administration of working with Indian intelligence agencies to support the Baloch rebels, thereby hemming it in between two hostile flanks – India to the east and Afghanistan to the west.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">With the Taliban in power, “Pakistan’s political influence will increase in Afghanistan”, Basit said.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Stability there would enable the extension of the US$65 billion China-Pakistan Economic Corridor into Afghanistan, he said, opening the way for Pakistan to trade more freely and frequently with Central Asia and export energy via Afghanistan.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">But Pakistan only stands to gain in terms of stability on its western border if the Taliban were able to govern effectively, accommodate other ethnic groups and establish lasting peace, ex-ambassador Lodhi said.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“Conversely, if they are unable to do so, Afghanistan could face an uncertain and unstable future which will not be in Pakistan’s interest,” she said.</p><img

blowback from the humiliated US government and its allies.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Islamabad will have to “bear the brunt of the Taliban’s oppressive policies in Afghanistan” because it was seen as the group’s main backer, Basit said. “The international community will judge Pakistan more than the Taliban for supporting them and helping them form a government in Afghanistan.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Mindful of this, officials told journalists and analysts in Islamabad this week that Pakistan had repeatedly advised Taliban representatives in recent months that it would not accord diplomatic recognition to its government if it sought to reimpose the brutal dictatorship overthrown by US invasion forces in October 2001.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Nonetheless, “fears in Islamabad have begun to germinate that the surprising calm of the last few days could give way to an orchestrated campaign of scapegoating Pakistan”, Fahd Husain, the Islamabad-based resident editor of Dawn, Pakistan’s biggest English language newspaper, wrote on Thursday.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=#

datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Meanwhile, the Taliban’s victory and triumphant jihadist narrative would embolden Islamist radical groups in Pakistan, Basit said.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The leaders of Pakistan’s two strongest Islamist political parties this week welcomed the Taliban victory, with one even offering to help the group with its plans for governance in Afghanistan.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“They will romanticise the Taliban, become more aggressive and less cooperative, and democracy, free speech and critical thinking will take a big hit,” Basit said.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The TTP has “gained a lot with the Afghan Taliban’s ascendance, including the materials of the Afghan military”, said Mir of Stanford University. The Taliban also released some 780 former TTP leaders and fighters from Afghan jails this week.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Rather than helping Pakistan, Basit said the Taliban government was likely to press Pakistan to negotiate with the TTP, “something which can become a point of inflection in the future”.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Playing on Afghan nationalist sentiment, the TTP recently announced plans to reoccupy Pakistan’s northwest tribal areas and establish an independent emirate there.</p><img data-qa=BaseImage-handleRenderImage-StyledImage src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/styles/wide_landscape/public/d8/video/thumbnail/2021/08/17/clean.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p data-qa=SCMPYoutubeVideoPreview-PreviewDuration class="css-dkee4u eaw92su1">01:28</p><p data-qa=SCMPYoutubeVideoPreview-PreviewTitle class="css-1ajvbe4 eaw92su2">China warns UN about a possible resurgence of terrorism in Afghanistan after Taliban victory</p><p>China warns UN about a possible resurgence of terrorism in Afghanistan after Taliban victory</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1">So will Pakistan recognise a Taliban regime – and how will American and Chinese expectations shape its decision?</h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Pakistan will recognise the Taliban government, according to the analysts, but not any time soon and based on conditions including the formation of a broad-based and inclusive government and respect of fundamental human rights.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Islamabad and close ally Beijing would coordinate their positions on Afghanistan, but “both will take it slow and observe instead of rushing in” to recognise the Taliban-led government in Afghanistan, Basit said, adding that Pakistan would also wait for Russia to be on board.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Mir said US-Pakistan ties would remain strained as well, with Washington asking for counterterrorism support and pressure on the Taliban.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The respective decisions of the US and Pakistan on whether to recognise the Taliban government will not be linked, however.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“If the Taliban behave responsibly and run their government moderately, US-Pakistan relations will stay afloat without showing any improvement,” Basit said, but if the situation in Afghanistan deteriorated, however, “US-Pakistan ties will nosedive”.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tK%2FMqWWcp51kxKaxymaYrKGRZLK5vMuaoKedlGSus8DInKOeZ2NmgXaDmGlmrZmcnq%2BiutJmmKyblaOxorrCsmSanpedrq%2B10q2Yp2WUpLK0ec%2BaoqKrpJa7br%2FTmqWdZZeWtq95zqs%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 DashJ - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
