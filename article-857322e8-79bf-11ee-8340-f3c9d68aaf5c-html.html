Nan and Robert always famously said that they “did not do steps,” so she is survived by her daughters Diane Dobbs (Randall) and Ann Marie Hathorn and her sons Mark Hathorn (Carol) and Bubba Hathorn (Cassie). She is also survived by her sisters Kay Winpigler and Carol Cooper; and her nine grandchildren, Johnny Dobbs (Susan), Kris Dobbs, Joseph Dobbs, Mallory Giovengo (Brandon), Erin Harrison (Nathan), Baylea Hogan, Brooklyn Tucker (John Thomas), Taylor Hathorn and Rob Parker. Nan also leaves behind nine great-grandchildren, Dalton Dobbs, Jordan Dobbs, Dakota Dobbs, Jaden Flynt, Sawyer Dobbs, Abree Giovengo, Scarlett Dobbs, AnaLynn Giovengo, Hollyn Tucker; special niece Lisa Winpigler; and numerous nieces and nephews.</p><p>Nan worked at M&M Bakery and later as a cafeteria worker and bus driver for the Jones County School District, where she loved cheering on the Mustangs (and later, the Golden Eagles basketball teams). Nan was widely known for taking seriously the greatest commandment to love your neighbor as yourself, as she never spoke a cross word about anyone. She faithfully served her longtime church family at Indian Springs Baptist Church and Salem Heights Baptist Church.&nbsp;</p><p>Visitation for Nan will take place on Friday, Nov. 3, from 1-2 p.m. at Memory Chapel Funeral Home in Laurel with the funeral at 2 p.m. A burial service will follow at Indian Springs Baptist Church cemetery. Memorials for Nan can be made to the West Jones High School athletic department, to the Southern Miss basketball teams, to the Gideons or to a church of your choice.&nbsp;</p><p>To sign the online guestbook, visit <a href=#><span>www.memorychapellaurel.com</span></a>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rbHAnZyrZZOWua16wqikaKeSnsG2rdGinKxnnpa7pMWMnqOispGXsrW0jKGYraCfp7twrdGtoJyklZSFdoOSa2mecF1shqOyjGponp1dbYB1fIyfapxxlGuFoq3FbppnoKSiuQ%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 DashJ - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
