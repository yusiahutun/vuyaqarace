In ancient China, it was called <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">“the food of emperors</a>.” Over in India, rulers ate it to feel younger and more energetic. In the last century, royals tapped its benefits — it’s rumored that <a href=#>Princess Diana</a> used royal jelly during pregnancy to prevent morning sickness. Today, research has uncovered compelling benefits that suggest why and how royal jelly is especially helpful for women — and something most woman over 40 should consider adding to their health arsenal.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>What is royal jelly?</h2><p>Beekeepers in the know refer to royal jelly as <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">a honey bee’s version of “a mother’s milk”</a>. It’s a protein-rich secretion produced by worker bees that is fed to all larvae for a period of time during&nbsp;<a href=#>the honey bee life cycle</a>. It’s also fed to the developing queen bee in extra amounts.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class=inline-stn-player></p><p>The exact makeup of royal jelly depends on several things, including the beehive’s location and the surrounding climate. In general, according to&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">ScienceDirect.com</a>, royal jelly consists of water (50-60%), proteins (18%), carbohydrates (15%), and trace minerals. It also contains at least eight essential amino acids, including a high proportion of “free” amino acids, which are thought to be <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">more readily absorbed</a> by the human body.</p><p>“Royal jelly is a good source of vitamins, minerals, amino acids, carbohydrates and proteins,” says <a href=#>Anna Chacon, MD,</a> a board-certified dermatologist and author based in Miami. “It’s particularly rich in B-complex vitamins, which help <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">transport oxygen and other energy-boosting nutrients</a> throughout the body.”</p><p>Scientists are trying to understand why royal jelly is so beneficial, but its nutrient-dense composition likely plays a role. Let’s take a closer look at the science:</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Royal jelly helps relieve menopausal symptoms</h2><p><a href=#>Menopause can cause symptoms</a> like depression and anxiety, brain fog, hot flashes and <a href=#>pain during sex</a>. Some women use hormone replacement therapy to treat these issues, but royal jelly may provide similar relief at a fraction of the price and with much less hassle.</p><p>An animal study in the journal Climacteric found that <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">royal jelly reduced depression</a> and brain fog in menopausal rats. Another found that postmenopausal women who took a royal jelly supplement daily experienced <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">relief from anxiety and back pain</a>.</p><p>But royal jelly’s menopause benefits extend beyond mental health. Consider that about <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">50 percent</a> of menopausal women have vaginal dryness, which can make sex uncomfortable or painful. “<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">One study</a> found that the vaginal use of royal jelly increased lubrication and decreased vaginal atrophy,” Dr. Chacon says. “There’s even evidence to suggest night sweats, hot flashes and other menopause-related issues can be relieved with royal jelly.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Royal jelly reduces age-related skin damage</h2><p>Royal jelly supports healthy, <a href=#>younger-looking skin</a>. In an animal study published in the Journal of Medicinal Food, researchers found that topical royal jelly <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">enhanced the production of collagen</a>, a naturally occurring protein that helps keep skin firm and wrinkle-free.</p><p>Yet another study found that royal jelly promoted skin and <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">wound healing</a> at the cellular level.</p><p>“Royal jelly offers cell-regenerating benefits,” Dr. Chacon says. “It lessens dark spots associated with aging and delays premature skin aging. Royal jelly can even prevent fine lines and wrinkles. Because it helps <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">increase collagen</a>, your <a href=#>skin appears younger</a> and more elastic.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Royal jelly makes PMS less intense</h2><p>PMS, or premenstrual syndrome, affects up to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">90%</a> of women.&nbsp;The symptoms vary but they can affect your mood, energy level and quality of life. Once again, royal jelly saves the day!</p><p>In a study in the journal Complementary Therapies in Medicine, when 110 college-aged women took an oral royal jelly supplement of 1,000 milligrams daily or a placebo for two menstrual cycles, those who took royal jelly experienced <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">50% fewer PMS symptoms</a>, while the placebo group experienced only a 5% decrease.</p><p>Scientists were unable to identify the exact mechanism responsible for this improvement. But it probably has something to do with a better hormone response.</p><p>“Royal jelly has demonstrated superior <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">hormone-balancing benefits</a> compared to other natural supplements,” says Dr. Chacon. “As a result, it’s helpful for women with hormone imbalances because it supports the endocrine system. Women with hormone-related reproductive problems may also benefit.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Royal jelly promotes healthy brain function</h2><p>Up to<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">68%</a> of perimenopausal women experience brain fog and other memory-related issues. Once again, royal jelly offers amazing benefits!</p><p>One study, from Frontiers in Aging Neuroscience, found that rats given royal jelly were better at <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">removing chemical buildup in the brain</a> associated with Alzheimer’s disease. Another found that royal jelly <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">improved memory</a> and reduced symptoms of depression in rats.</p><p>It may even help protect the brain from stress. Scientists <a href=#>have found</a> that royal jelly helped rats experience a reduction in <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">corticosterone</a>, a hormone responsible for certain stress responses. The same study found that the treated rats had stronger central nervous systems overall.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Royal jelly is good for the heart</h2><p>Many menopausal and postmenopausal women have <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">high cholesterol</a>. This often occurs because of hormone fluctuations, but it’s possible to counteract. Rather than relying on medication, consider royal jelly.</p><p>Several studies have found a link between royal jelly and lower cholesterol. For example, one animal study had rabbits take a royal jelly supplement for three months. At the end of the test period, the rabbits experienced a<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener"> 28% reduction in LDL or “bad” cholesterol</a>.</p><p>Another<a href=#> study</a> found that humans who took royal jelly daily for a month had <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">11% lower total cholesterol </a>and 4% lower LDL or “bad” cholesterol than those who did not.</p><p>Researchers don’t know why royal jelly affects cholesterol, but it may be due to its high B vitamin content. Royal jelly has vitamins <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">B1, B2, B6, B8, B9, and B12</a>, all of which are thought to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">help lower high cholesterol</a>.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Royal jelly keeps bones strong and healthy</h2><p>About <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">80%</a> of the 10 million Americans with osteoporosis are women. While a calcium supplement may provide some defense, so too, can royal jelly.</p><p>One animal study, conducted by Turkish scientists, found that a combination of royal jelly and <a href=#>bee pollen</a> helped <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">prevent bone loss</a> in female rats. In fact, the bone mass density and calcium levels of rats that took royal jelly and bee pollen were significantly higher than those of rats that didn’t.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Royal jelly can help you lose weight</h2><p>“Royal jelly is a beneficial addition to your diet because it’s high in nutrients and low in calories,” says Dr. Chacon. “It can boost your energy as well, allowing you to push your workouts to the next level.”</p><p>Science confirms this thinking. In a study of women with type 2 diabetes, researchers found that those who supplemented with 1,000 mg of royal jelly ate fewer calories, cut their carb intake and<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener"> lost weight</a>. Those who didn’t supplement increased their calorie intake and gained weight.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Is there anyone who shouldn’t use royal jelly?</h2><p>Royal jelly is a natural product made by worker honeybees, but it can present risks. If you’re allergic to bees or honey or have other environmental allergens, talk with your doctor first. You should also speak with your doctor if you have <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">dermatitis</a>.</p><p>Likewise, if you’re pregnant or nursing, avoid royal jelly. There isn’t much research on how royal jelly affects breast milk or growing babies, so it’s best to look for a substitute.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>What should I consider when buying royal jelly?</h2><p>Royal jelly can be applied topically or consumed in its raw form — or in the form of oral supplements, liquids and topical ointments. Some royal jelly does contain pesticides, so look for words like “non-GMO” and “organic” on the label for the purest product.</p><p>The best way to choose a royal jelly product is to consider the outcome you want to achieve. “If you have a specific skin problem, a topical treatment might be a better option,” says <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Jeanette Kimszal, RDN</a>, a registered dietitian and the founder of <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Root Nutrition & Education</a>. “However, there is still a lot unknown about these compounds. Nutritional supplements aren’t regulated like medications, so you want to look for one that has quality ingredients and is backed with third-party testing.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>What’s the recommended dosage of royal jelly?</h2><p>When supplementing, the recommended dosage of royal jelly when ingested varies. “The appropriate dose depends on several factors, including your health and age,” says Kimszal. “300-6,000 milligram (mg) doses have been shown to have the most effective results. But it’s best to start with a lower dose and see how you’re affected, as royal jelly can be very potent.”</p><p>As with any new supplement, it’s always best to talk with your doctor first. She can point you in the right direction and alert you to potential interactions with the medications and supplements you already take.</p><p>This content is not a substitute for professional medical advice or diagnosis.
