However, it is worth getting the best you can afford – although you do not need to spend a fortune.&nbsp;</p><img id=i-aa67d31a9d01294c src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2017/01/20/16/3C494FBC00000578-0-image-m-47_1484930090385.jpg height=716 width=634 alt="Monty Don (pictured with his dog Nellie) talks you through his trustiest gardening tools" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p class=imageCaption>Monty Don (pictured with his dog Nellie) talks you through his trustiest gardening tools</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Many of my own have been bought cheaply at auctions and clearances or ironmongers. Wherever they come from, at this time of year it makes sense to sort out your tools, clean and repair those you love and look to replace or invest in those you lack.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>To start with, every gardener must have a decent spade. There are plenty of ‘bad’ spades out there but a good spade will hold its edge, feel light and easy to use yet be robust enough to dig as long as your back (or in my case, knees) will hold out.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>It should also be versatile enough to dig a hole for a large tree or gently chop a herbaceous plant into new sections. A border spade should have the same virtues but is much smaller and useful for working in tight spaces.</p><h3 class=mol-factbox-title>ASK MONTY...&nbsp;</h3><p class=mol-para-with-font>Q The leaves on my hybrid tea roses in pots have been badly eaten but I cannot see any bugs. Any advice?</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Joe Noor, Bucks</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>A If there are neat semi-circular spaces in the leaves, this is the work of leafcutting bees (above). They do not harm the plant and are important pollinators. More random holes may be down to slugs or rose sawfly larvae, in which case ventilation and repotting with fresh compost can help.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Q I have a six-year-old bird-of-paradise plant in my conservatory which has never flowered. Can you help?</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Thomas Keith Morris, Coventry</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>A Strelitzia reginae like growing in a conservatory that is humid but not too hot. They need plenty of ventilation but should be watered very sparingly in winter, then more frequently from spring and given a liquid feed every fortnight. Your plant may well be happier living outside from late spring to autumn except when there is frost.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Q My neighbour’s lawn is wrecked by magpies seeking chafer grubs and I fear for my own grass. What can I do?</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Trevor Brace, Herts</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>A Chafer grubs feed on the decaying roots of plants such as grass. The grubs reach maturity in autumn, which is when the birds most actively hunt for them. Improving aeration and drainage will help. You can use nematodes to attack the grubs, watering them into the lawn while the soil is still warm.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span class=mol-style-italic>Write to Monty Don at Weekend, Daily Mail, 2 Derry Street, London W8 5TT or email monty.don@dailymail.co.uk.

I prefer square tines (as opposed to round or flat) of stainless steel that are not too long and not too curved and are robust enough to serve arduous use. A small border fork is also useful for lifting a plant without damaging its neighbours. It is worth stressing that digging is always best done with a spade. Keep the fork for breaking up the soil once dug or for lifting plants.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>One rake will do but three is a counsel of perfection. For general preparation of a seedbed, a round-tined flathead rake is best. A spring-tine rake doubles as a grass scratcher and leaf collector, and rubber rakes are invaluable for gathering up leaves from borders without damaging plants and seedlings.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>If you grow vegetables you must have a hoe. The design of a hoe depends upon whether you push the cutting edge through the soil or pull it back towards you. For smaller, annual weeds it is best to push, cutting through the roots of weeds just below the surface of the soil. Keep it sharp and keep it small.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Do not try to save time by using a big-bladed hoe. A small one is twice as useful. Bigger weeds are best chopped out with a swan-neck or draw hoe. A good mattock (shaped like a small pickaxe) can be very useful for rough digging as well as weeding.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>You do need a good trowel or two for planting, one big and one small. A word of caution: cheap trowels just do not last, so go for quality of manufacture and metal, and the same goes for the final essential piece of gardening kit – decent secateurs.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>As with any cutting tool, they are only as good as the steel that the blades are made from. The shape, colour or detail of design is a matter of subjective taste but high-quality steel holds an edge and makes pruning easy.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>And that is really the secret to all efficient gardening tools. They should make your work easier and more pleasurable to do, and they should also look good. Just like your garden.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pa3IpbCmmZmhe6S7ja6iaJ6Voq6quI6gmKuclaO2r7OOmqmtoZOhsm6AkG1oaWhmZJqwutOyZH2nnmLBorjKrGStqqWowaqx0q1koJmimbKvtc2gZK2nn6HAb7TTpqM%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 DashJ - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
