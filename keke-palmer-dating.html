In her opening monologue, she addressed the rumors that she was pregnant. “There’s some rumors going around, people have been in my comments saying, ‘Keke’s having a baby, Keke’s pregnant,’ and I wanna set the record straight — I am!” she said as she opened her coat to reveal a very pregnant belly. “I gotta say, though, it is bad when people on the internet spread rumors about you y’all, but it’s even worse when they’re correct. I mean, like, I was trying so hard to keep it on the down low, cause I got a lot of stuff going on, you know? But honestly this has been the biggest blessing, and I am so excited. Guys, I’m going to be a mom.”</p><p>Related Stories</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/keke-palmer-darius-jackson-1.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Keke-palmer-usher-video.png><p>Keke has been <a href=# rel=noopener>very private</a> about her dating life in the past. “I’ve always had the same philosophy when it comes to dating,” she said in a <i>Harper’s Bazaar</i> interview in March 2020. “Not that I wouldn’t give someone a try. But trying to keep my private life outside of my work life, to me, it’s easiest when you don’t date someone with the same career.” She continued, “I think a lot about, like, does this person really like me for me? And it’s not just romantic relationships. It’s friends too. That wavering, that’s the most traumatic thing about fame.” In a <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">TikTok</a> she posted in December 2021, she captioned, “<span class="_aacl _aaco _aacu _aacx _aad7 _aade">I don’t believe in girlfriend and boyfriend. I’m single till we married. Let’s just kick it love 🙄”</span></p><p>So who exactly is Keke Palmer’s baby daddy and who did she date in the past?

After her SNL hosting duties she <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">thanked her boyfriend</a> on Instagram, “thank you to my other half <a class="x1i10hfl xjbqb8w x6umtig x1b1mbwd xaqea5y xav7gou x9f619 x1ypdohk xt0psk2 xe8uvvx xdj266r x11i5rnm xat24cr x1mh8g0r xexx8yu x4uap5 x18d9i69 xkhd6sd x16tdsg8 x1hl2dhg xggy1nq x1a2a7pz notranslate _a6hd" tabindex=0 role=link href=# rel=nofollow>@dvulton</a> for giving me the things that only true unity can bring. Love is all we have isn’t it, you do nothing in this world alone and trust me, I am not alone.”</p><p>In a now-deleted post from October 2021, Keke posted an Instagram post with the caption, “Without being too mushy because I HATEEEE THAT, it feels really nice to not be afraid to show this kind of care for someone that I don’t share the same blood with. I thought it could never happen, I can be quite guarded, but I appreciate you for being a safe space. I will always cherish what you have given me.”</p><p>Darius also wrote a sweet now-deleted Instagram birthday post for his girlfriend. “You’ve been a blessing from above,” he wrote at the time. “Never would have expected summer 2021 to turn out the way it did, but here we are.
