Here, Harper’s Bazaar chats to one half of the label, Liushu Lei, to find out more about the brand that’s taking the fashion industry by storm.</p><h2 data-node-id=6 class="body-h3 css-11vz3s8 emevuu60">What inspires your designs?</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=7 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">"Many things inspired the designs of the new collection; for this season, the main things are films, graphic novels and comic books from the manga series. Our new spring/summer 2022 collection draws inspiration from ‘Aim for the Ace’ which follows the story of a high-school student named Oka Hiromi who struggles to overcome the hardship of training to become a professional tennis player. We always find animation shows particularly influential when designing, as well as Western culture."</p><h2 data-node-id=8 class="body-h3 css-11vz3s8 emevuu60">What’s the story behind creating your label and where did your love of fashion begin?</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=9 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">"Tongtong and I are from the same high school - we knew of each other however we never really spoke. We then went to the same university and both moved to London to study at London College of Fashion; we were classmates and roommates. We made the plan to start Shushu/Tong while we were on the bus back home. It was a very spontaneous choice for us and we are so thankful for how it has turned out.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=10 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">"When I was younger, I watched a TV show on CCTV (our national television station), and [someone was wearing] a dress which was really low on the waist and back, I remember this so clearly. I was also practicing to become a cartoonist, but I realised that I was more interested in what the characters were wearing and not how they looked and this made me realise that I should give fashion a try."</p><img alt=shushutong title="SHUSHU/TONG " width=2000 height=3000 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/look29-1636648906.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Courtesy of shushu/tong</span></p><h2 data-node-id=12 class="body-h3 css-11vz3s8 emevuu60">You studied at London College of Fashion, how does fashion school differ in China when compared to the UK?</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=13 class="body-text css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">"Studying in London is very different to studying in China. At London College of Fashion (LCF), you are making the clothes, testing fabrics the whole time and it's a lot more hands-on. Back in China, we spend more time drawing and using PowerPoint than we do actually making the clothes. I think it has probably changed a bit since I was studying in China, but that was the main thing I noticed when I came to London – I loved how creative and free I was when I studied at LCF. We learned so much while studying, I feel like my time there made me feel like a real designer."</p><h2 data-node-id=14 class="body-h3 css-11vz3s8 emevuu60">‘Trademark squatting’ is a common issue for brands in China. What plagiarism have you faced as a brand and why is this such a problem?</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=15 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">"I think it has given us all a lesson and the law must be treated seriously. When you create a brand then the first thing you should do is legally to get it trademarked."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=16 class="body-h3 css-a83egm emevuu60"><strong><strong>How is China’s fashion scene changing?</strong></strong></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=17 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">"I would say the last five or so years the fashion scene has really escalated in China; there are more emerging designers, more people seem to have found their personal style and it is just so different from how it was. Everything in China changes so fast. When I think back to the last year and a half since the pandemic so much has changed in such a short amount of time from how the fashion industry works to how people chose to dress and the entire fashion scene."</p><h2 data-node-id=19 class="body-h3 css-11vz3s8 emevuu60"><strong>Why is it important to have fun with fashion and self-expression?</strong></h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=20 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">"For me, when you are touched by fashion it's very precious; the emotion is very pure and sometimes, very simple. Fashion is notorious for being superficial but it does delight our ordinariness. We need clothes to identify ourselves; we need clothes to express ourselves for when we don’t have the words for how we’re feeling. Some people claim they don't care about fashion and end up with the ‘no fashion’ look and that in itself somehow becomes a look of fashion. Fashion really is so personal and it’s different for everyone."</p><h2 data-node-id=21 class="body-h3 css-11vz3s8 emevuu60"><strong>Your designs are made with the woman in mind and not for the male gaze. Do you think that’s something we still see in fashion?</strong></h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=22 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">"The male gaze is everywhere because of the long history but some part of the male gaze is now becoming the female gaze. I think we should respect all kinds of design, and let people decide which to choose. Otherwise, the anti-male gaze campaign is just another version of power politics."</p><img alt=shushutong title="SHUSHU/TONG " width=2000 height=3000 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/look26-1637060554.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Courtesy</span></p><h2 data-node-id=24 class="body-h3 css-11vz3s8 emevuu60"><strong>What advice would you give to someone who wants to be more expressive with what they wear?</strong></h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=25 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">"Believe in yourself and believe in your aesthetic. Confidence comes in time and the more you experiment then the more confident you will feel."</p><h2 data-node-id=26 class="body-h3 css-11vz3s8 emevuu60"><strong>Your brand is loved by fashion’s most stylish women, what do you provide to consumers that they can’t find elsewhere?</strong></h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=27 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">"It’s such an honour to us that people choose to wear our brand.
