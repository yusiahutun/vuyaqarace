The contract includes incentives that could take the contract to as much as $115 million, the reports said. "I wanted a chance to come back," Mayfield told ESPN. "I love Coach (Todd) Bowles and the staff. I'm happy to be here, and I want to win more in the postseason." Mayfield, 28, was the No. 1 overall pick in the 2018 draft by the Cleveland Browns but was traded to the Carolina Panthers after his first four seasons there, which included the franchise's first playoff appearance in 18 years. He split an unsuccessful 2022 season with the Panthers and Los Angeles Rams before catching on with Tampa Bay last year following Tom Brady's retirement. Mayfield threw for career highs of 4,044 yards and 28 touchdowns with 10 interceptions while starting all 17 games. Tampa Bay won the NFC South and beat the Philadelphia Eagles in the wild-card round of the playoffs before falling to No. 2 seed Detroit. In 89 games (86 starts) over six NFL seasons, Mayfield has career totals of 20,332 passing yards, 130 touchdowns, 74 interceptions, 823 rushing yards and seven scores on the ground. --Field Level Media</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rbHAnZyrZZOWua16wqikaKugpL%2B1v46nmK2hn6OurXvBmqKeql2irrqyyJ6jnWWSlrCsedaiq6FlkqqwtHnOp2SrnaCkv7Wxw2ZqZrGVlr9ufY9ppGaclZa5cK3RraCcpJWUsqR9l2lnb2xdbbOigYxunW%2BcXZaCpX%2BMbpucaZFngaV%2FkGubZ6Ckork%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 DashJ - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
