Her husband, right, was convicted on one count for locking up his son<br></p><h3 class=wocc><b>FAKING IT: WHAT IS MUNCHAUSEN?</b><br></h3><p><span>Doctors found that Leslie Wilfred had Munchausen and Munchausen by proxy.</span></p><p><span>In both conditions, the person purposefully fabricates medical conditions so that they can get attention or sympathy. Munchausen syndrome patients tell falsehoods about themselves, while in Munchausen by proxy, an adult will invent medical conditions for his or her child.</span></p><p><span>A dangerous facet of this is how they will often induce symptoms in the child to better illustrate the lie. Munchausen by proxy is typically considered a severe form of child abuse.</span></p><p><span>They belong to a group of conditions called factitious disorders, which are either made up or self-inflicted. If it is not discovered, it can lead to death from self-inflicting the harm or because of harming the child.<br></span></p><p><span>Dr. Marc Feldman, an international expert in the disorder, told Fox: 'It is a diagnosis of people who evolve lifestyles in which they travel from hospital to hospital, getting themselves admitted and subjecting themselves to surgery they don't need.</span></p><p><span>'What they have in common is this quest for sympathy â€“ a desperate search and yearning for some kind of identity as a patient or the vicarious identity of a patient.'</span></p><p><span>Due to the dishonest nature of the condition, it is hard to say how many people in the U.S. suffer from Munchausen syndrome, but it is considered to be rare. It generally more typically occurs in men than in woman and most often affects young adults.<br></span></p><p><span>Wilfred claimed that her other children also suffered from medical conditions and that one child, who was then 11, was the result of her being raped by her co-worker. This was never reported to police.</span></p><p><span>Around this time, Wilfred also claimed she had fallen pregnant with the couple's twins. She took pictures of her rounded belly - but did not reveal to friends or family that she had actually had her tubes tied ahead of the marriage, making a pregnancy impossible.</span></p><p><span>In 2008, the couple called the police about Chris' son, claiming he had threatened the family with a knife. They complained he was unruly and neighbors rarely saw him leave the home.</span></p><p><span>After the knife incident, Child Protective Services launched an investigation and Wilfred regularly met with a caseworker - who noticed some bizarre behavior.</span></p><p><span>'During this whole period of time when the mother would be talking to his attorney, she made several references about his behavior being responsible for the safety and wellbeing of her unborn twins,' Brettel told Fox.</span></p><p><span>It was almost as if she was predicting the future.<br></span></p><p><span>On November 10, 2008, Wilfred called her husband and family from hospital to say the twins, who she had been carrying for five months, were stillborn and had been cremated.<br></span></p><p><span>Three days later, the family gathered to mourn the babies at the family's local church, where their ashes were placed in teddy-bear shaped urns and ultrasounds were put on display.</span></p><p><span>Little did the family know that the urns had been ordered five days ahead of the 'birth' and that the ultrasounds belonged to a stranger - and had been downloaded from the internet.</span></p><p><span>When CPS learned about the stillbirths, they contacted Brettel, who in turn contacted the hospital - and found they did not have records of her check ups or birth.</span></p><p><span>As the investigation continued, officers learned that the eldest son did not need a liver transplant and they questioned whether his gallbladder had been removed unnecessarily.</span></p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2013/08/27/article-2403154-1B7CCAF7000005DC-366_634x460.jpg height=460 width=634 alt="Mistreatment: She claimed one of her daughters, pictured, had leukemia and one of her sons needed a liver transplant.
