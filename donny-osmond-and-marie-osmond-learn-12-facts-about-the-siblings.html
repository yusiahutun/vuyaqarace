Although the brother-sister duo have transformed their careers to become worldwide superstars, there are still tons of facts you might not know about them.</p><p>The pair’s show, <a href=#>Donny & Marie</a>, first aired back in 1976 and made them the youngest entertainers in TV history to host their own hit variety series. Fast-forward nearly 40 years, and Donny and Marie are juggling their lives as parents, siblings, spouses and entertainers.</p><p>The “Paper Roses” songstress and the <a href=#>Masked Singer</a> alum have celebrated many career milestones together. Aside from starring on their variety show for two seasons until 1979, they went on to appear in Goin’ Coconuts, toured the country and much more.</p><p>In 2008, Marie and Donny announced a six-week residency in Las Vegas. However, their show ended up being so successful that they <a href=#>headlined at the Flamingo Hotel and Casino</a> for over 11 years. At the time they announced they would be ending their residency for good in March 2019, fans were heartbroken.</p><p>Fortunately, the “I’ll Make a Man Out of You” singer insisted this wouldn’t be the last you would see of the sibling pair. “It’s the end of the Donny and Marie show,” he shared during their announcement on <a href=#>Good Morning America</a>. “It’s not the end of Donny and Marie.”</p><p>The <a href=#>Talk</a> alum echoed her brother’s sweet sentiment during an exclusive interview with Closer in October 2019. “<a href=#>There’s this thing called DNA</a> that kind of like makes you close,” Marie joked at the time. “Donny and I, we have so much history together. I mean, we’re family.”</p><p>Whether or not Donny and Marie ever team up again in the future, they couldn’t feel more grateful to have been by each other’s side throughout their iconic run — even if they “never [saw] eye-to-eye.” For now, Donny is headlining his own <a href=#>solo residency at Harrah’s</a>, which is expected to run until November 2022, while Marie is focusing on her music and acting career.</p><p>“We can finish each other’s sentences and we know what each other’s thinking, but we are very different people. <a href=#>That’s our chemistry</a>,” the stunning TV host jokingly shared with Closer in January 2019. “[Donny] loves everything organized and structured, while I like to breathe within the structure of the show. I’m always throwing a curveball at him. He goes crazy and it makes me laugh so I keep doing it.”</p><p><strong>Scroll through the gallery below to see 12 fun facts about Donny and Marie!</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLjOrJyrr5WauK3FjZympmegpMC1v46dpqemqWK8tLnOp5tmmZ6Zeq6t0aKcZqejoryvsIylnJqqnmJ%2Bc3nFmpqtq12Wr7DB02aroZ1dqLajuMinnqxn</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 DashJ - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
