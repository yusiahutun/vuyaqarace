If you're <a href=#>Harry Styles</a> and you want to impress <a href=#>Taylor Swift</a> on Christmas, the answer is easy: You give her the gift of song.<span id=more-144908></span></p><p>The <a href=#>One Direction</a> celebrity had to spend the holiday 3,500 miles away from his country crossover lady, but he still found a way to make her feel special. According to the <a href=#>Sun</a>, Styles hired someone to sing his band's hit song 'What Makes You Beautiful' to Swift on Christmas Day. Styles asked the singer to perform the song with a country-western twang to appeal to Swift's favorite style of music.</p><p>The 'Red' hitmaker apparently did get to see Styles on Christmas, but they had to trade in a face-to-face meeting for a Skype date. The two young celebrities exchanged gifts while they chatted through the video service.</p><p>“Even though they were apart on Christmas Day, he wanted to make sure she’d be thinking of him," an anonymous source reports to the paper. "The singagram was an ideal present."</p><p>“She has a great sense of humor. He knew she’d think it was hilarious,” the in-the-know person added.</p><p>Swift hasn't officially called the British boyband star her beau yet, but all evidence points to the fact that the two singers are dating. They've been spotted together in New York City, Manchester, Los Angeles and Aspen, Colo, holding hands while globetrotting.</p><p>“Harry and Taylor can’t get enough of each other. Any moment they can spend together, they do," the source reveals. "But Harry is also very close to his family. He wanted to be back home with them for Christmas."</p><p>It sounds like Styles did his best to make Swift feel special from across the pond. Whether they are dating or not, a singing telegram is sure to score him some major points!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskajBprvFnKaupqSnxm%2BvzqZmrZmpobyzedKwoJ%2BsXai2r7PIp55mrJWhsqi%2BwKZkoZmip8Zuv9Oyo56rXw%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 DashJ - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
