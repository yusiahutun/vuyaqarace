Especially against the F-35, it will allow access to a modern fifth-generation platform for nations that otherwise would not be able to either afford, or be allowed, to import the F-35,” Tigkos said.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“Most countries in the Middle East operate fourth-generation fleets and need to quickly transition to fifth-generation platforms to stay current and improve survivability of their aircraft against modern and integrated air defences.”</p>Last month, Pakistan’s Air Chief Marshal Zaheer Ahmed Baber Sidhu announced that <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">Pakistan planned to buy the FC-31</span></a> among efforts to modernise its air force, but did not give further details of the procurement.<p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The Catic official at the defence show in Riyadh also declined to provide any further details about the FC-31 deal with Pakistan.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Tigkos said China had an edge in price and export restrictions because of Washington’s delay in approving exports of the F-35 to the Middle East allowing “plenty of room for competition to step in and offer other designs”.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/styles/wide_landscape/public/d8/video/thumbnail/2024/01/19/thumb-clear.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">However he said introducing a Chinese or Russian stealth platform was likely to be “detrimental” for the importers because it was likely to sour relations with the US and prevent them from accessing other advanced equipment.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“Let’s consider [that] the major Middle East nations have all purchased advanced air defence and infrastructure from the US while also operating almost exclusively US fighters,” Tigkos said.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“If they buy Chinese, they risk a clash with the US, which could, in turn, result in perhaps sanctions.
