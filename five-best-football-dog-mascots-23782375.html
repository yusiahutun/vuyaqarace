his age as 20 years old, or 115 in dog years.</p><p>County are currently seventh in League Two, just inside the play-off places, under the management of Mike Flynn, with Spytty recently telling fans to “Keep the faith.”</p><p>It is not just on the football pitch where Spytty can be found, with the dog also winning the 2018 Newport Mascot Race.</p><h3>Donny Dog (Doncaster Rovers)</h3><img

mascot for League One side Doncaster Rovers.</p><p>He also has his own matchday programme, as well as a kennel in the Family Stand at Rovers’ Keepmoat Stadium.</p><p>It is not your normal dog kennel though, with Donny being able to enjoy Playstation 4s and Xbox Ones, as well as reading messages from fans on a blackboard.</p><h3>Toby Tyke (Barnsley)</h3><img

the Tykes, Barnsley feature Toby as their mascot.</p><p>A tyke is a dog whose ancestry is unknown, though Toby is believed to have been the Barnsley mascot since the mid-90s.</p><p>As well as a parody Twitter account, Toby also has his own cartoon series, published by the club.</p><h3>Beau Brummie (Birmingham City)</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto

spirit after all the trails and tribulations they have experienced in recent seasons.</p><p>The character dates back to the 1960s when cartoons of a similar dog were featured in Birmingham’s programme.</p><p>Remarkably, Beau also had a kidnapping scare in 2012 when he went missing, with the club saying: “All that we want to see is the safe return of Beau Brummie to St Andrew’s.”</p><p>Thankfully, it turned out that rather than being kidnapped Beau was taking a break until the club started spending money, though it has not turned out as he had hoped, with Blues now fighting relegation.</p><h3>Terry the Terrier (Huddersfield Town)</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto
