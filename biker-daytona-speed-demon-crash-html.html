outside Daytona Beach.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>He accelerates to nearly three times the speed of other vehicles on the busy road as the wind buffets his powerful Honda CBR600RR.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>He passes within inches of other vehicles and at one point glances back to check that his camera has not been blown off by the hurricane-force wind speeds before accelerating further.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>But four minutes into his ultra-high speed jaunt the traffic suddenly becomes ominously heavier.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Trying to switch lanes through a narrow gap in the traffic he slams into the back of a black pick-up truck, knocking it out of its lane and leaving him poleaxed and seemingly unconscious on the handlebars of his bike.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>As his bike continues riding under its own momentum an 18-wheeler he had passed seconds earlier brushes past him, clipping his leg and sending him spinning onto the tarmac before coming to rest in a ditch with blades of grass around his now still camera.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'I call it an accident, but it was clearly my fault,' he admitted on YouTube.</p><p
