Who would have though a show about a furry alien wiseguy that comes to earth to live in an American family’s garage would be such a hit, but it was.&nbsp;</p><p>ALF (which stands for Alien Life Form), premiered on NBC in 1986 and ran for four seasons. It was a combination of a classic family sitcom with the wackiness of a cartoon character come to life.&nbsp;At the core of the show was ALF, a funny, sarcastic, hairy creature who was always causing chaos in the Tanner household.</p><p class=inline-stn-player></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Here, 18 surprising facts about the show</h2><h3 class=wp-block-heading>1. The show’s creator was also the voice of ALF</h3><p>The show was co-created by&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Paul Fusco</a>, who was also the voice of the star, ALF. Fusco created the character from a puppet he had in his house. He used the puppet to play tricks and pranks on family and friends. He had the idea that the character might make a good television show (he was right).</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>2. Initially the producer was not interested in the show</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.firstforwomen.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/02/4_7278cf.jpg><p>Producer&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Bernie Brillstein</a> was initially not interested in ALF, because he managed&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Jim Henson</a>&nbsp;(of the Muppets fame) and regarded Henson as the best puppeteer in showbiz. However, once Brillstein saw Fusco in action, he thought the character was really funny and gave the green light to do the show.&nbsp;The show appeared on NBC for 99 episodes.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>3. The final episode was a cliffhanger in hopes the series would get renewed</h3><p>NBC cancelled&nbsp;Alf&nbsp;in 1990 after production wrapped for season four, leaving the final episode as an unresolved cliffhanger. Ironically, the writers wrote it this way in hopes of pressuring NBC to renew the show for another season. It didn’t work.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>4. The television series launched a movie</h3><p>A television movie, Project ALF, came out in 1996. It co-starred Martin Sheen was produced by ABC. The movie gave closure to the story line.

The human cast had to maneuver around the puppet and the trap doors.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>14.
