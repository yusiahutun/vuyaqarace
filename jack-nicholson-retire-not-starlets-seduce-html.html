But I can’t remember where I live.’</span></p><p><span>I thought of that gag when I heard reports last week that Jack Nicholson, Hollywood’s original and most irrepressible Jack the Lad, might finally be feeling his age.</span></p><p><span>Not because he has declared himself too old to be photographed flirting with popsies young enough to be his granddaughter, the most recent of whom was 23-year-old actress Jennifer Lawrence. No, that’s not it at all. Apparently, it’s because he keeps forgetting his lines.</span></p><p><span>Friends of the 76-year-old king of the Hollywood hellraisers have been quick to rubbish these rumours, but it wouldn’t be the first time Nicholson has flirted with retirement. Indeed, he mooted it as long ago as 1986, after watching coming-of-age comedy Ferris Bueller’s Day Off.</span></p><p><span>‘That movie made me feel totally irrelevant to anything that any audience could want,’ he later said, adding that it made him feel ‘119 years old’ and that he walked out of the screening ‘thinking my days are numbered in the Hollywood film industry’.</span></p><p><span>Well, Nicholson is a whole lot closer to 119 now, and yet there has been no evidence in recent years that his acting days might be numbered, or that there might be no more Oscars to add to the three he already has.</span></p><h2>RELATED ARTICLES</h2><ul class="rotator-pages link-xocc"><li class=rotator-prev><a href=# data-page=prev>Previous</a></li><li><a href=# data-page=1>1</a></li><li class=rotator-next><a href=# data-page=next>Next</a></li></ul><ul class="rotator-panels link-bogr1 linkro-ccox"><li><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2013/09/12/article-2418895-1BC78582000005DC-113_87x84.jpg width=62 height=60 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto> <span>Life is suite!

There aren’t that many who are dead either.</span></p><p><span>What makes the suggestion of his retirement so shocking is that Nicholson’s staying power has become a Hollywood institution in its own right, practically as concrete as the Walk Of Fame on Hollywood Boulevard.</span></p><i><b><span>Just ask Leonardo DiCaprio, Matt Damon, Martin Sheen and Alec Baldwin. They were all terrific in Martin Scorsese’s excellent 2006 crime thriller The Departed, but Nicholson stole the picture from under their noses</span></b></i><p><span>The twin certainties in the American film industry are that Woody Allen will be directing, and Jack Nicholson acting, when hell freezes over. Or so it sometimes seems.</span></p><p><span>Even in a business with no fixed retirement age, it takes some doing for a man just to be in gainful employment, let alone still winning plaudits, 40 years after his most productive decade.</span></p><p><span>For me, the Seventies were Nicholson’s truly halcyon years — and his performance as the reluctant mental asylum inmate Randle McMurphy in One Flew Over The Cuckoo’s Nest (1975) his ultimate tour de force.</span></p><p><span>Others will disagree. They might point to his private investigator in Chinatown two years earlier, or to his role as the psychotic anti-hero of The Shining (1980), or the affecting charm of the romantic comedy As Good As It Gets (1997).</span></p><p><span>But it must be five years since I last saw Cuckoo’s Nest and still I can picture his every scene, testament to that extraordinary, animalistic charisma that sometimes, as when he played The Joker in Batman (1989), seems almost too big for the screen.</span></p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2013/09/13/article-2419568-00B62B5D00000578-157_634x420.jpg height=420 width=634 alt="Jack Nicholson on a beach in St Bart's, carribean, surrounded by younger fans" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p class=imageCaption>Jack Nicholson on a beach in St Bart's, The Carribean, surrounded by younger fans</p><p><span>Just ask Leonardo DiCaprio, Matt Damon, Martin Sheen and Alec Baldwin. They were all terrific in Martin Scorsese’s excellent 2006 crime thriller The Departed, but Nicholson stole the picture from under their noses.</span></p><p><span>‘I don’t want to be a product of my environment, I want my environment to be a product of me,’ he growled as mob boss Frank Costello, and there are times when Nicholson himself seems to embody that equation.</span></p><p><span>In the flesh he is said to radiate even more electricity than he does on screen, with one interviewer noting that a simple request for ‘water, plain water’ reduced a hotel waiter to trembling cack-handedness.</span></p><p><span>So, although he is sometimes criticised for simply playing himself — his louche and roguishly charming turn in 1987’s The Witches Of Eastwick being but one prime example — there is plenty of himself to play.</span></p><p><span>His relationships with women alone could fill a book — or perhaps a manual on psychoanalysis.</span></p><p><span>‘Jack always has the same dynamic with women, tremendous push-pull,’ said his friend, Hollywood producer Harry Gittes, in Easy Riders, Raging Bulls, Peter Biskind’s acclaimed 1998 book about the workings of the film industry.</span></p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2013/09/13/article-2419568-003C7C4B1000044C-798_306x423.jpg height=423 width=306 alt="Film - One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest (1975) starring Jack Nicholson" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p class=imageCaption>His finest hour? Jack Nicholson starring in the 1975 film One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest for which he won an Oscar</p><p><span>Gittes asserted that every relationship begins with the woman pushing hard&nbsp; for his attention, and him pulling away.</span></p><p><span>Then eventually, she pulls back, either disillusioned or plain exhausted, and he pushes like mad.</span></p><p><span>‘The key word is control,’ said Gittes. ‘As soon as he lost control of his women, he went out of his mind.’ In Biskind’s blunt assessment: ‘An analyst might say he liked to sleep with women, but he didn’t like them.’</span></p><p><span>That may or may not be the case, but if it is, then the analyst would almost certainly look to Nicholson’s strange New Jersey upbringing, and the revelation by a Time magazine journalist in 1974 that the couple he considered to have been his parents were actually his grandparents, while his late ‘sister’ had been his mother.</span></p><p><span>Either way, the list of Nicholson’s high-profile girlfriends extends almost as long as his film credits, and includes actresses Rita Moreno, Jill St John, Candice Bergen and Lara Flynn Boyle, as well as former Canadian First Lady Margaret Trudeau and shipping heiress Christina Onassis.</span></p><p><span>The only women to tie him down for any length of time were Sandra Knight, whom he married, Anjelica Huston, and Rebecca Broussard.</span></p><p><span>At the most recent count, he had four children. And if you think he’s slowed down these days, consider that comment not so long ago, when he said — perhaps in jest, perhaps not — ‘I only take Viagra when I’m with more than one woman’.</span></p><p><span>Amazingly, given such a record, Nicholson’s status as a man’s man exceeds even his reputation as a ladies’ man.</span></p><p><span>His appetite for drink, drugs and partying might have waned (though there is no firm evidence it has) but for decades it was so prodigious that the comedian Robin Williams cited Nicholson as the one man in the world to whom Keith Richards of the Rolling Stones, a good friend, might say: ‘Sorry Jack, I really have to go home now.’</span></p><p><span>The late Marlon Brando, also no slouch on the hell-raising front, was his next-door neighbour and one of his closest pals. And maybe that’s another reason why we should lament the very idea of Nicholson retiring: his name evokes wild nights with Brando, and an era when Hollywood set the world a thoroughly bad example.</span></p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2013/09/13/article-2419568-008011C800000258-750_634x412.jpg height=412 width=634 alt="JACK NICHOLSON & PETER FONDA Film 'EASY RIDER' (1977) 01/05/1977 CTF17892" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p class=imageCaption>Jack Nicholson and Peter Fonda (right) in the 1977 roadie film, Easy Rider, which made him a star</p><p><span>Movie stars then were so much less wholesome than the current crop of characterless and frankly interchangeable young leading men, and much more interesting.</span></p><p><span>So we need Jack Nicholson to stay as visible as possible for as long as possible.</span></p><p><span>We need him sitting courtside at his beloved LA Lakers basketball games, looking inscrutably enigmatic behind the ever-present shades, and we need him photographed with those young girls on his arm.
