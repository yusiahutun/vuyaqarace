During one of his episodes, Kelce revealed how much he wanted to meet Swift and exchange numbers with her after attending her Eras Tour concert in Kansas City. He later revealed more of the backstory in a November 2023 interview with the <a href=# rel=nofollow>Wall Street Journal</a>, telling the magazine that Swift reached out after listening to his episode. “She told me exactly what was going on and how I got lucky enough to get her to reach out,” Kelce shared, adding, “I’ve never been a man of words. Being around her, seeing how smart Taylor is, has been f—ing mind-blowing. I’m learning every day.”</p><p>Related Stories</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/travis-kelce-kiss-marry-kill-taylor-swift.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/reba-mcentire-taylor-swift.jpg><p>It wasn’t long before the pair began making public appearances together. In September 2023, the Grammy winner attended her first Chiefs game, decked out in team gear and cheering on her beau from a private box alongside Kelce’s mother, Donna. Since then, Swift has become a regular at both regular season and playoff games. Her appearance at the games has sparked quite a bit of attention, sparking criticism among some NFL fans. In her December 2023 TIME cover story, Swift addressed this backlash from some fans, humorously coining the phrase “dads, Brads, and Chads.”</p><p>Yet, many pro football stars, including Kelce’s boss Clark Hunt, have commended Swift for bringing a new audience to the sport. Speaking of whom, the Kansas City Chiefs owner has been witness to Swift and Kelce’s relationship—and he opened up about the pair in a recent interview to address speculation that their relationship is all a “marketing stunt.” Keep on reading below to hear his thoughts.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=are-taylor-swift-travis-kelce-a-pr-stunt>Are Taylor Swift & Travis Kelce a PR Stunt?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/taylor-swift-travis-kelce.png><p>Is Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce’s relationship a PR stunt? Well, if you’re asking Kansas City Chiefs owner Clark Hunt, the answer is no. During his recent appearance on <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Mad Money on CNBC</a>, Hunt, 58, gushed about the couple, dispelling any notions of their relationship being a “marketing stunt.”</p><p>“Well, first of all, we’re so happy for Travis Kelce and Taylor in their relationship. I’ve had a chance to meet her at one of the many games that she’s attended this year,” Hunt shared. “She’s just as sweet as she can be. I also got to see her play here [at our Arrowhead Stadium] twice this past summer and what an incredible performer. I mean, just one of the most incredible artists of our time.”</p><p>He continued, “It’s been a very interesting, very fun year having the two of them dating. The attention that’s been focused on the Chiefs, our female audience has grown leaps and bounds. That’s right, it was purely organic.”</p><p>“You know, when they were just starting off dating, there were a lot of people saying, ‘Oh, it’s a marketing stunt,’ but no, it’s very real,” he told CNBC, adding, “and the most important thing is we’re happy for the two of them.”</p><p>Our mission at STYLECASTER is to bring style to the people, and we only feature products we think you’ll love as much as we do.
