But a cultural critic fears it is another example of private tastes being turned into a public good.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The auctioneer, which has seen sales in Hong Kong nearly double in the past year, will take 48,000 sq ft (4,460 square metres) of space in the 16-storey building.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Phillips will have five-and-a-half floors in the building – the two top floors with a triple-height space and a 14-metre-tall glass window overlooking the harbour will be for auction previews and other exhibitions, and three lower floors as retail space. The remaining half floor will be office space.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-TitleText class="css-66qo9a eeeqn932">Work by little-known US artist sells for nearly US$1 million in Hong Kong</span></p></a></h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Stephen Brooks, Phillips’ chief executive officer, said: “Phillips’ expanding presence in Asia is a critical component of our growth strategy with Asian participation in Phillips’ auctions becoming such a significant force. We have seen over 30 per cent increase in Asian client interaction with Phillips since the start of lockdown last year.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“I am delighted we will have a state-of-the-art permanent sale room presence in such an exceptional, and world class, cultural destination in West Kowloon.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2021/12/16/d27a6674-9e0a-4ae0-ad65-5e459eb20a69_37197229.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The move is in line with the auctions industry’s shift away from its business model of twice-yearly flagship auction weeks in Asia to having year-round sales of art and collectibles.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Jonathan Crockett, chairman, Asia, of Phillips said: “This exciting move and addition of permanent exhibition space will allow Phillips Asia to expand our offering as well as hold exhibitions, auctions and other events throughout the year.</p>“Being located at the heart of the <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">West Kowloon Cultural District</span></a> will allow us to work alongside <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">M+</span></a>, the <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">Hong Kong Palace Museum</span></a> and the wider district on complementary programming and events, further enhancing the area as a world-class global destination for arts and culture.”<img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2021/12/16/6dc3421b-202f-442f-a583-1c299b7c915c_40bf4451.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The authority will not disclose the rent Phillips will pay, but says the income generated from the deal will be used to finance the operation and development of the cultural district.</p>Asked if the embrace of an auction house that sells objects whose makers’ works are also exhibited in the <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">M+ museum</span></a> next door would constitute a conflict of interest and undermine curatorial independence, the authority said it “adopts a professional, objective and impartial attitude in curating and hosting exhibitions, performances, and arts and cultural events”.<p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“The museums in [the West Kowloon Cultural District] have well-established, international-standard acquisition policy, as well as a robust governance structure and procedures defined by the policy approved by the [authority] board and the relevant governing bodies,” it added.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2021/12/16/402c5eec-9b73-4714-9a77-982a3f9c9682_be713e31.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Such a rental arrangement was in line with the approved development plan of the cultural district and was part of a “well-established financial model to sustain the operation and development of the district and support the pursuit of its cultural mission”, it said.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The close relationship between a public cultural body and the private sector has its critics.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Artist, curator and critic Anthony Leung Po-shan sees it as the latest sign of the cultural district normalising a symbiotic relationship between public museums and commercial or private interests.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“From day one, the entire district was meant to be built through public and private partnerships. Traditional rules on museum ethics are not applicable. This is where private tastes are transformed into a public good, and where businesses can share in the district’s cultural capital,” she said.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">In addition, it reflects the belief that success in the art market - notoriously susceptible to manipulation and lacking transparency - equates to artistic success, Leung says, before adding: “But this is what young artists want now, and perhaps that’s what the WKCDA takes into account.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2021/12/16/0d592828-cc7c-44a7-b307-217d974e769b_20651673.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The authority earlier announced that it faced a HK$491 million (US$63 million) operating deficit before depreciation and interest expenses for the financial year 2020-21 and at the end of that financial year had only HK$7.9 billion left of the Hong Kong government’s HK$21.6 billion upfront endowment with many of the cultural venues in the district still unbuilt.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2021/12/16/134e0649-b4c6-45f5-a57e-bb4f231f6189_69d8353b.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Phillips, a smaller rival to Sotheby’s and Christies, says its 2021 Asian sales reached a record high of HK$2.1 billion this year and that of the top ten lots auctioned by Phillips worldwide year-to-date, five went to buyers from Asia, confirming its belief in the long-term potential of the Asian market.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tK%2FMqWWcp51kuaqyxKyrsqSVZK6zwNJmmq6kpKq%2FpnvAq6uim5yafHR9lHJwaXFfpbWquMuip6xlkaqwtbXOp2Shp6Wosm6%2FxK1kmquZlnqpvYyhpqefXaC8r7OMp5yxrF2jsrh5zA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 DashJ - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
