Using a backup generator, of course.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Oukitel has just launched its brand new Abearl P5000 and P5000 Pro portable power stations, which are designed to keep you in the juice even when you're off grid (or when the grid fails you). Keen to know more about these portable powerhouses? Read on...</p><h2 id=abearl-p5000-and-p5000-pro-pricing-and-availability>Abearl P5000 and P5000 Pro: Pricing and Availability</h2><p>You may well already know the Oukitel brand. It is prominent in the rugged smartphone space, and has now turned its expertise to manufacturing its own sub-brand in order to manufacture and sell a range of high powered solar power stations. Oukitel has experience in the portable power space (<a href=#>we reviewed its P2001</a> back in January '22), but the Abearl P5000 and its Pro variant are market leading 5 kWh devices—a world first at this energy density.</p><p>The Oukitel Abearl P5000 and P5000 Pro have both just launched on Kickstarter on February 3rd, ‘23. You can head to the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored">Kickstarter page</a> to find out more about the campaign, or you can head over to the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored">Oukitel official website</a> for a great deal more information on the two new devices.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>At the time of writing, both models are enjoying super early-bird pricing, with up to 50% off the cost of your new power station. Prices start at $4,999 for the P5000 ($2,499 while the super early-bird offer stands) and at $5,999 for P5000 Pro, ($3,299 while the super early-bird offer stands), and there is an additional coupon for the Abearl P5000 and P5000 Pro. Users can pre-pay $100 to get $500 cashback on the Oukitel official website after the campaign ends. Let's delve into the specifics of the P5000/Pro and see what all the fuss is about.</p><h2 id=the-abearl-p5000-and-p5000-pro-specifications>The Abearl P5000 and P5000 Pro: Specifications</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/abearl-p5000-pro-key-selling-points.jpg><p>These portable power stations are very well-specced, and offer plenty of gumption for when you need a backup home battery. Specs-wise, we're looking at the following:</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h3 id=oukitel-abearl-p5000-pro>Oukitel Abearl P5000 Pro</h3><ul><li>5120 kWh capacity</li><li>4000 W AC output</li><li>120V/240V split phase</li><li>1600 W (US version)/2200 W (EU version) UPS function</li><li>LiFeP04 Battery, up to 3500 charge cycles</li><li>Superfast 1.8-hour charging (combined AC and solar)</li><li>Weighs only 51 kg</li></ul><h3 id=oukitel-abearl-p5000>Oukitel Abearl P5000</h3><ul><li>5120 kWh capacity</li><li>2200 W AC output</li><li>1400 W (US version)/2000 W (EU version) UPS function</li><li>LiFeP04 Battery, up to 3500 charge cycles</li><li>Superfast 1.8-hour charging (combined AC and solar)</li><li>Weighs only 50 kg</li></ul><h2 id=what-we-love-about-the-oukitel-abearl-p5000-and-p5000-pro>What We Love About the Oukitel Abearl P5000 and P5000 Pro</h2><p>The Oukitel Abearl P5000 and P5000 Pro both have a lot going for them, specs aside. Here's plenty of plus points for these portable power stations.</p><h3 id=the-abearl-p5000-is-a-solar-generator>The Abearl P5000 is a Solar Generator</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/oukitel-abearl-p5000-powering-caravan.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>There is really nothing more satisfying than getting something for free. And you can harness the power of Earth's nearest star (the sun), to charge your <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored">Abearl P5000 or P5000 Pro</a>. Both of the devices can hook up to a photovoltaic panel (which you can purchase alongside your new home generator), which will then charge your P5000 without you even needing to spend an additional dime, once you've bought the equipment.</p><p>This makes the Abearl P5000 perfect for use anywhere. You can take it camping with you and charge it au naturale, or you can have it powering your off grid home if you place it alongside a bank of several P5000 power stations. You can buy them in pairs, with a solar panel, and grab yourself a saving in the process.</p><h3 id=the-abearl-p5000-is-a-totally-portable-battery-generator>The Abearl P5000 is a Totally Portable Battery Generator</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/oukitel-abearl-p5000-powering-electric-vehicle.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The ability to take power anywhere you go can really offer you a lot of freedom; if you own a motorhome, for example, you might want to stop in a place with no access to a power point. In instances like this, you need a power source that is portable. Even if you want off-grid power in different rooms in your home, at different times, you can as long as the power source is easily movable.</p><p>Step in the Abearl P5000 and P5000 Pro. Both of them have a wheeled base, so you can move them around with the greatest of ease. They also have an extendable handle, so no awkward lifting of heavy home batteries; just extend the handle and move the P5000 around at your will. No power in the kitchen? No problem! Just wheel your P5000 in and enjoy hours of home battery backup power.</p><h3 id=completely-green-energy>Completely Green Energy</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/oukitel-abearl-p5000-on-a-campsite.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The Abearl P5000 and P5000 Pro are both devices with the potential to be 100% green. Given that you can charge them using the sun, and they produce zero emissions, this is conscience-free power for the environmentally minded. Are you looking to reduce your carbon footprint? Well, with the Abearl P5000 and P5000 Pro, you can reduce your reliance on the grid, and therefore be greener in the process.</p><p>Plus, the lifetime of the P5000 is approximately seven times longer than that of your standard home battery. With 3500 cycles under its belt, the usual 500 recharges you get with other portable power stations pales in significance. This, of course, means you won't have to dispose of the device for a much longer period of time, which is better for the environment (and you can recycle it with a specialist afterwards, too).</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h3 id=the-abearl-p5000-powers-plenty-of-appliances>The Abearl P5000 Powers Plenty of Appliances</h3><p>You're probably looking at these figures and wondering exactly what you can run off the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored">Abearl P5000 and P5000 Pro</a>. Well, lots, as it happens, with Oukitel claiming you can charge or power around 99% of your devices with these 5 kWh home batteries. So what does that mean in real-world terms? Here are some examples of what a 5120 kWh solar generator can power, and for how long:</p><ul><li>Refrigerator: 96 hours</li><li>Space heater: 5 hours</li><li>Air conditioning unit: 4.5 hours</li><li>Microwave: 5 hours</li><li>CPAP machine: 90 hours</li><li>Electric vehicle: 25 miles equivalent charge</li><li>Circular saw: 3.7 hours</li></ul><p>So, as you can see, the Abearl P5000 has plenty of applications.</p><h3 id=the-abearl-p5000-power-for-everyone>The Abearl P5000: Power for Everyone</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/oukitel-abearl-p5000-in-workship-with-carpenter.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>You have seen some examples of use cases above, and how long the P5000 Pro will last in each situation. The selling point here is that the Abearl P5000 and P5000 Pro are devices suited to almost every user. Whether you need it as a backup in case you have no power for your life-saving equipment like a CPAP machine, or you want to power your home workshop tools off grid, you can with Oukitel's Abearl P5000-series home generators.</p><p>Essentially, if you use electricity (which literally everyone does), then you have a use for a portable power station. If it charges via solar and is portable—like the Abearl P5000 and P5000 Pro, then you're onto a winner. Plus, the devices are affordable at the point of purchase, and will save you a fortune in electricity bills in the long-run, and nobody can argue with that.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=your-next-portable-power-purchase>Your Next Portable Power Purchase</h2><p>So, you've seen what specs the Oukitel Abearl P5000 and P5000 Pro possess.
