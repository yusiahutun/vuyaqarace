When he was four months old, his mother complained he looked like he was one<strong>&nbsp;</strong>year old. He too was 6ft 2 in, and was already fighting in battles aged 12.&nbsp;</p><p id=eEdyVlMITOW data-wc=53>The tallest British monarch was Edward IV at 6 ft 4Â½ in (194cm). When suited and booted in armour, the King would have stood at roughly 6 ft 7 in. Edward ruled for nearly 22 years from 1461 to 1483, with a brief gap in 1470 when he was deposed for six months.</p><p id=eWrRahiw8q_U data-wc=31>Wesley called the Prince "warm, charming and respectful to everyone," saying: "William is maybe a new kind of leader who can keep the monarchy relevant and resonant in the coming decades."&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/e12034789aa9-gettyimages-2089839765.jpg><h2 data-gid=e_Q06RVryE>The shortest British monarchs&nbsp;</h2><p id=eNzKJMnLpZi data-wc=36>As for the more vertically challenged monarchs, coming in first place was Queen Victoria at a neat 5 ft 0 in (1.52 m). An American visitor to London described her as a "pleasing lady-like little woman".&nbsp;</p><p id=etSD6U-pnUT data-wc=56>Height was a sore spot for the shortest king, Charles I, who reigned from 1625 to 1649. At 5 ft 4 in (1.63 m) he made sure to wear high-heeled shoes and was always painted to create the illusion of height. He became a head shorter when he was executed by Oliver Cromwell and the Parliamentarians.&nbsp;</p><h2 data-gid=euTL8OhDCSu lang=en-gb>What William will be known as once he's King</h2><p id=eK0DUNEMsj data-wc=11>So what will William be called when he takes the throne?</p><p id=ez_-LVaqIr data-wc=82>royal editor and broadcaster Roya Nikkhah was a guest on <strong>HELLO!</strong>'s A Right Royal Podcast last year and said of the future King: "He will be William (V) for sure. When he launched Earthshot he was the Duke of Cambridge, but he called himself Prince William. And that's because he's keen to be known as Prince William, because the Americans know and love him as Prince William, they love him above all other public figures, according to a recent poll."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/ba88737f6d6f-prince-william-charles-coronation.jpg><p id=eiy5Sk2f-H data-wc=35>Roya was quick to explain the differences between William as a monarch compared to his predecessor: "He'll be a very radical monarch. The monarchy will look very different quite quickly. He will change a lot."</p><h2>How William's role is already changing</h2><p id=eeHzgUQd8b data-wc=40>With wife Princess Kate and father King Charles recovering from cancer, the responsibility has fallen more heavily on Prince William's shoulders over the weeks as he aims to be there for his family and continue to carry out royal duties.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/e5bad5351e0c-prince-william-kate-coronation.jpg><p id=e28v2tXckwC8 data-wc=45>However, in another episode of <strong data-gid=e0R8YEeq63>HELLO!</strong>'s A Right Royal Podcast, author Ingrid Seward explained how the <a class=hm-link href=# rel=noopener>King gave his son permission</a> to spend more time with his family, while his wife was recovering from abdominal surgery, and as we now know, processing her cancer diagnosis.</p><p data-wc=41 id=e6sGYAwiv1>"I think Charles has encouraged William to spend more time with the family and also said to William, 'I don't want you to take on any royal duties until you absolutely have to' because you remember we criticised William the work-shy?&nbsp;</p><p data-wc=36 id=er1JEWbw3dc>"And that was his father very much saying, 'You don't have to do this, be with your young family.
