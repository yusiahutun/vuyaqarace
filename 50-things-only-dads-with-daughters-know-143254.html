Activation Director for Mattel, which conducted the study for Barbie, said, “By joining in with activities such as cartwheels and playtime, dancing, and making fairy wings together, dads are showing their daughters just how much they matter — and that everything they do is important.”</p><p>Dads of daughters know it is important to shatter stereotypes — and that girls want to play football, build dens, and climb trees too.</p><p>The study shows that half of dads know it is important to show their daughters that being kind and brave is more important than being pretty, and when it comes to empowering their daughter, 42 percent of dads tell their daughters that they can be anything.</p><p>Dads help their daughters prepare for the future, with 54 percent thinking that encouraging their daughter’s confidence is one of the most important life lesson they can teach, while 51 percent try to teach her practical skills.</p><p>Letting their imaginations soar is key for a third of dads who believe their daughter’s dolls help foster imagination.</p><p>When dads join playtime, two thirds recognize that this helps build their daughters self-confidence and that time spent in her imaginary world is an investment in her real world — while four in 10 wish they could devote more time to playing with their daughters.</p><p>Letting her make her own mistakes, teaching her the value of money at an early age, and encouraging her to be brave are amongst the other “life lessons” dads try to give their little girls.</p><p>And researchers found that for eight in 10 dads with a daughter, empowering them to become strong young women is of utmost importance.</p><p>As Dr. Linda Nielsen of Wake Forest University explains in her work, decades of research show that girls who have loving, communicative, supportive relationships with their dads from early childhood on are less likely to suffer from a lack of self-confidence and self-reliance as she grows up.</p><p>Wendy Hill, Brand Activation Director for Mattel continues: “A huge part of a dad’s role is to empower their daughters to be confident, imaginative and sure of who they are.”</p><p>“Global research shows how time spent in her imaginary world is an investment in her real world, and the importance of nurturing the father-daughter relationship to raise the next generation of girls to know their limitless potential.”</p><p>This post was written by the editors of Mother & Baby.
