I think that's an interesting thing to explore."</p><p>Depp was directly asked about the Rolling Stone exposé about the show's alleged production issues -- which included losing its original director, Amy Seimetz, before scrapping the almost entirely-finished product and starting over from scratch. When asked about her own experience with series creator Sam Levinson, however, Depp only spoke of him highly.</p><p>"I had the best time ever working with Sam and I've said this before, he's my favorite director that I've ever worked with," she said. "I've never felt so creatively inspired and fulfilled and like I learned more, also, I feel like I learned more on this set than I have ever. I've never felt more respected and more safe on a set, honestly.</p><p>"It felt like a really safe creative space," she added.</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:15fac69b-7439-4a7d-b15c-b627dbb6257e data-container-ref=toofab:article:5124f300-9629-4240-b2df-e16101ff22b7 data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=27><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/fb/5by4/2023/06/14/fb90a848ff6440c7bd214d3faa4c21aa_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">Max</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">The Weeknd Defends Character's Controversial Sex Scene in The Idol: 'It's So Gluttonous'</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><p>Her co-star, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" title=https://toofab.com/people/the-weeknd/><strong>The Weeknd</strong></a> previously addressed some of the controversial scenes.</p><p>In an interview with <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>GQ</strong></a>, The Weeknd -- whose real name is <a href=#><strong>Abel Tesfaye</strong></a> -- <a href=#><strong>defended one disturbing moment from the show's second episode</strong></a>, and described sex in the series as "gluttonous."</p><p>"There's nothing sexy about it," Tesfaye said, noting that they used the 1992 film "Basic Instinct" as a "reference" for the series.</p><p>"How ever you're feeling watching that scene, whether it's discomfort, or you feel gross, or you feel embarrassed for the characters," he continued. "It's all those emotions adding up to: This guy is in way over his head, this situation is one where he is not supposed to be here."</p><p>Tesfaye went on to share thoughts about his character, calling Tedros a "douchebag" and "such a loser."</p><p>"You look at him, and this is a score -- Jocelyn might be the biggest score he's ever had. It's very obvious," he told GQ. "He's over-indulging, he walks into this house looking around like, 'Goddamn, am I way over my head? This can be the biggest job I've ever done.' Whatever it is that he's doing."</p><p>The season finale of The Idol airs Sunday on HBO.</p><a id=gallery-link-a3ca5e0d-2bab-4e4c-832c-74c59516ab26 class="media-link gallery-block__link js-track-link js-click-gallery" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:gallery:a3ca5e0d-2bab-4e4c-832c-74c59516ab26 data-context='{"name":"gallery-block","section":"permalink"}' data-container-ref=toofab:article:5124f300-9629-4240-b2df-e16101ff22b7 data-gallery-layout=carousel><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/b5/4by3/2023/06/26/b5ac38fc239644cf9d86c1978b6de5b6_md.jpg width=825 height=618 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmisn6Szoq6NnKamZ2Jlf3R7j29ma3FfobatxYyrpqydXZmysbyMnZyfnZ6ZwG661J2grbFdqbWmecidpqVn</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 DashJ - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
