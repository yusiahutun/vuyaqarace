You may not know what’s gonna happen next, but that’s exactly what makes this next adventure so exciting.</p><p>As the week begins, you may find yourself attracted to something—or someone—that represents new emotional territory. February 7 brings Venus—<a href=#>planet of love, </a><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">friendship</a><a href=#>, and desire</a>—forming a trine with innovative Uranus, allowing you to feel brave enough to give someone a chance who isn’t normally your type. It’s a great time to try new things. Mars—<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">planet of passion and drive</a>—will also sextile dreamy and empathic Neptune, increasing your desire for something exalting and out of this world.</p><p>However, some unexpected bumps in the road could leave you feeling uncertain of what move to make next by February 8. This is when <a href=#>the </a><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Aquarius</a><a href=#> sun</a> will square unpredictable Uranus, which could cause plans to go awry and strange occurrences to temporarily blow you off course.</p><p>All of this is paving the way for a powerful <a href=#>new moon </a><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>in</a><a href=#> Aquarius</a> on February 9. Taking place at 20 degrees Aquarius, this is the first new moon you’ve ever experienced while Pluto—<a href=#>planet of generational </a><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>changes</a>—is also moving through Aquarius. This could represent something unfamiliar and completely uncharted, and ready or not, you’re a main character who has been thrust into a brand new story.</p><p>You’ll likely feel enthusiastic and optimistic about what’s coming next, especially as Mercury in Aquarius squares off <a href=#>with Jupiter in </a><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Taurus</a> on February 10. This could bring big ideas and idealistic thinking, but remember to be practical and to avoid making grandiose promises that you’re not sure if you can keep. Avoid biting off more than you can chew.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/astrologynewslettersignup.png><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=how-the-planets-will-affect-your-zodiac-sign-this-week>How the Planets Will Affect Your Zodiac Sign This Week</h2><p>Here’s what you can expect from the upcoming week, according to <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>your sun</a> and/or <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>rising sign</a> (and seriously, you’re missing out if you don’t read these horoscopes for your rising sign):</p><ul class="pmc-fallback-list-items lrv-a-unstyle-list lrv-u-margin-t-2"><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=6.6641414141414><h2>Aries</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/zodiacbannerday_aries.png><p>This week, nothing is stopping you.</p><p>On Monday, February 5, Mercury in your house of friendships conjoins Pluto in Aquarius.
