It hurts. It's a very senseless act," added the victim's niece, who still has questions about what happened.</p><p>"I want to know why? Why wasn't the fight stopped?" she asked. "They told us there was a male supervisor that couldn't break up the fight because they were quote unquote 'two really big guys.' They didn't do their part. My uncle was the kindest person you could meet. He would give you the shirt off his back even if he didn't have one."</p><p>So far, the nursing home hasn't commented on the incident.</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:61d18a74-7d63-48b2-88c8-9adafee47f81 data-container-ref=toofab:article:b4e5a446-0cd1-41fa-9aef-75deed0f7953 data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=29><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/2e/5by4/2023/11/10/2ea53b2744e1485b8534efc45778afde_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">BULLITT COUNTY DETENTION CENTER</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">Boys, 6 and 9, Found Fatally Shot in Bedroom -- Mom Accused of Murder</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmisn6Szoq6NnKamZ2Jlf3R7kGpma2lfrLatuMiapGaokaiwqa3LpWSnraKotq%2BzjKGmpp1dm7aotNNmrpqrmJ67qHnMmpqhoZ6aeq7B0Z2cq2WTna6zs8SsZg%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 DashJ - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
