"The way I look, I can’t play a scientist, or a judge. So, I decided to seek a life for myself," she said.</p><p>However, in an interview back in 2015, Sofia confessed that her natural 34Fs are starting to droop.</p><p>Speaking to of <a href=# rel=nofollow>Vanity Fair</a>, she said "Believe me, I wish I had fake boobs. I lay down and they completely go down like all the way, like here. It’s not fun.”</p><p>Sofia, who started her career in modelling after being discovered by a photographer while on a beach, also admitted she's been aware of the power of her good looks from a young age. She revealed boys in high school always wanted to be with her, so it didn't take her long to start using her looks to her advantage.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i2-prod.dailystar.co.uk/incoming/article31955452.ece/ALTERNATES/s458/0_MAIN-donna.jpg><p>Sofia went on to credit her body for her success in Hollywood. "It would be absurd to deny it or for that to make me feel bad," she said. She explained: "My giant boobs and my body opened doors for me; they were my passport to the world when I was 20 years old when I started as a model."</p><p>But the talented actress pointed out she's maintained an impressive acting career for decades as she claimed her continued success isn't just down to her body, but her fearless nature. She continued: "Today I’m 51 years old and I’m still here because I am not afraid of [taking a] risk, I work harder than anyone, I have the personality, I have always been aware of what was outside, and I have not been afraid."</p><p>Sofia noted there are women in Hollywood who are "prettier, younger" and have "bigger breasts and a better body" than her but declared she's stuck around because she's earned her place. Going on to explain why she's so willing to take a risk, she said: "I don’t do brain surgery, it’s just entertainment, and the worst that can happen to me is that they can say I look ugly or that this jackass doesn’t know how to act. I can take it."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/s2-prod.mirror.co.uk/@trinitymirrordigital/chameleon-branding/publications/dailystar/img/logo-schema-dailystar.png><p>She hit out at those who still only take notice of her body rather than her talent, adding: "If you only see my boobs, then that’s your problem." During the interview, Sofia also opened up about her recent split from her husband of nearly eight years, Joe Manganiello, revealing their marriage ended because he wanted children.</p><p>"My marriage broke up because my husband was younger; he wanted to have kids, and I didn’t want to be an old mum," she said. Sofia welcomed her only son Manolo during her first marriage to her high school sweetheart Joe Gonzalez, who she wed when she was just 18.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i2-prod.dailystar.co.uk/incoming/article31941736.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/1_Sofia-Vergara-channels-sexy-secretary-in-tight-leather-dress-with-glasses.jpg><p>Her son is now 32 and Sofia revealed she's "ready to be a grandmother, not a mother." She said: "I’m almost in menopause; it’s the natural way of things."</p><span class=factbox-header><h3>Join the Daily Star's WhatsApp for the sexiest headlines, showbiz gossip and lots more</h3></span><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i2-prod.dailystar.co.uk/incoming/article31962846.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_Sofia-Vergara-mirror-selfie.jpg><p>The Daily Star is now on WhatsApp and we want you to join us!</p><p>Through the app, we'll send you the sassiest showbiz stories, some naught headline and a seismic smattering of aliens...along with the latest breaking news of course.</p><p>To join our community, all you have to do to join is<b><a href=# rel=nofollow> click on this link</a></b>, select 'Join Chat' and you're in!</p><p>No one will be able to see who has sign up and no one can send messages except for the Daily Star team.
