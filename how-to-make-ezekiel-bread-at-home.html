This nutrient-packed superfood requires a bit more effort to make than traditional bread recipes, but the results are totally worth it.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>What is Ezekiel bread?</h2><p><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Ezekiel bread</a> gets its name from the Bible, specifically <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Ezekiel 4:9</a>, which says, “Take wheat and barley, beans and lentils, millet and spelt; put them in a storage jar and use them to make bread for yourself.” Those ingredients form the base of Ezekiel bread, though you’re welcome to get creative with your additions to the recipe.</p><p class=inline-stn-player></p><p>What makes Ezekiel bread so special is how nourishing it is. Ezekiel bread is made with sprouted grains, meaning the grains have germinated or started to grow before being ground into flour. The benefits of using sprouted grains are twofold: First, this process reduces the amount of antinutrients — substances that prevent the body from absorbing nutrients — &nbsp;in your grains. (Cooking, <a href=# rel="dofollow noopener noreferrer">fermenting</a>, <a href=# rel="dofollow noopener noreferrer">soaking</a>, and sprouting are popular methods that get rid of antinutrients.) Second, sprouted grains have higher nutrient levels on top of fewer carbs and gluten. (That said, Ezekiel bread is not gluten-free.)</p><p>Another reason Ezekiel bread is popular with people who are trying to lose weight is because it’s made without sugar. Store-bought versions are sugar-free, but you can add a dash of honey to your recipe if you prefer. A loaf is also brimming with filling fiber that will help curb any unhealthy food cravings during the day.</p><p><strong>Related: </strong><a href=#>Where To Store Bread In The Kitchen: The Best Place Is Actually a *Drawer*</a></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Ezekiel Bread Recipe</h2><p>The traditional version of this bread calls for water, honey, olive oil, yeast, wheat flour, spelt flour, millet flour, green lentils, beans of your choice, and salt. Ready to learn how to make Ezekiel bread at home? Get started with this simple recipe:</p><li>Mix honey, olive oil, water, and yeast in a big bowl. Let mixture sit five minutes.</li><li>Combine whole grains and beans, then grind using flour mill or blender.</li><li>Add grain and bean mixture to yeast blend. The dough will be very sticky.&nbsp;</li><li>Transfer dough to a proper pan and let rise for 45 minutes.</li><li>Set oven to 350 degrees Fahrenheit and bake bread for 45 to 50 minutes or until top is browned.&nbsp;</li><li>Let cool and enjoy.</li><p>What you do with your bread next is up to you. Ezekiel bread is a denser, drier type of bread, so many people enjoy toasting it before slathering it with fruit jam or <a href=# rel="dofollow noopener noreferrer">fat-burning ghee</a>. It’s also wonderful under a smashed avocado, poached egg, and a drizzle of hot sauce.&nbsp;</p><p>No matter how you slice it, Ezekiel bread is one of the healthiest breads on the market — and it can fit in perfectly with your diet. We’re not loafing around when we say that Ezekiel bread can change your life.</p><p><strong>Related:</strong> <a href=#>Best Container to Keep Bread Fresh: This OXO Cereal Box, Says TikTok Influencer</a></p><p><strong>For more healthy bread recipes:</strong></p><p><a href=#>Cottage Cheese Bread Has Just 2 Ingredients, Boasts 50% More Protein + It’s Easy To Make</a></p><p><a href=#>The White Bread That’s Actually *Good* For You: Why Top Docs Recommend Sourdough</a></p><p><a href=#>This Soft, Melt-in-Your-Mouth Irish Soda Bread Is Ready to Bake in Just 10 Minutes</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7p7XRrKufp6KsvK6xzWeaqKVfpby0wNJonainlGK%2Fpq%2FIqZysZ5ikxG7AzmakmqOVYrK7scqinKVlkqeyorCMmqtmoJ%2Bisg%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 DashJ - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
