For example, detangling in the shower prevents breakage but requires a waterproof brush that can perform well without tugging. Meanwhile, brushes with boar bristles help craft slicked back styles and beautifully lay down edges.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-1 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Simply put, there’s a different brush for every curl pattern, hair type, and styling preference, so finding the right brush for your needs can feel overwhelming. To make your search easier, we put 25 of the most popular brushes for curly hair to the test in our Manhattan Lab. Along with evaluating each brush on multiple curl patterns, we analyzed each tool’s grip, how seamlessly it glided through knots, how much shedding it caused, and how well it defined coils.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-2 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">From paddle and round brushes to ball point detanglers and boar bristle stylers (and everything in between), we narrowed down the pool of products and found the best brushes for curly hair.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-overall-curls-ultimate-detangler-brush></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Overall</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Curls Ultimate Detangler Brush</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Curls Ultimate Detangler Brush" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/qNbnE8yMcGRZKh03gpNApbExheM=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/curls-ultimate-detangler-brush-5406fbe3ebb748f8adf3dd7939fa1028.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>&nbsp;Amazon</p></span><p>Our Ratings</p><ul class=product-record__attribute-ratings-list><li class=rating-list-item><p>Ease of Use</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Comfort</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Performance</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li></ul><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>This brush efficiently detangled our curls in a single pass.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love: </strong>With its wider size, it was heavier than most of the brushes we tested.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-2 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">This Curls brush claimed our best overall spot for its smooth glide, extremely gentle detangling capabilities, and unique customization options. Honestly, we had never used a brush that made such an immediate difference in our curls.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-3 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">From the first pass, the firm yet soft bristles glided through our wet hair, working to remove tangles without any tension or ripping. Typically, we need at least two passes to completely rid our hair of knots, which in the past has resulted in excessive shedding. With this brush, one was enough to totally detangle, resulting in less hair loss, too. Once our hair dried, we noticed our <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>curl pattern</a> was tighter, bouncier, and more defined than usual. Plus, our coils looked more voluminous.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-4 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">We appreciated that the brush also came with interchangeable bristle patterns to accommodate curly hair of all types — from wavy and coarse to thin and ultra thick. Changing out the bristles was as simple as sliding the cushion out, inserting a new pad, and snapping it into place. We’ve broken a few brushes over the years (due to the thick nature of our hair), so we like that the extra bristle pads make this a more sustainable option. And although the brush was a bit heavier than other options we tested, it was still perfectly comfortable to handle.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-5 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Bristle Material:</strong> Plastic | <strong>Curl Pattern: </strong>All types</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-budget-tgin-define--style-detangling-brush></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Budget</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>tgin Define + Style Detangling Brush</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="tgin Define + Style Detangling Brush" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/Og4N7nJMz1yWD8jF38n_BLuEevQ=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/tgin-09e0b9f1e4f643f184a038f2f5c46a8b.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Ulta</p></span><p>Our Ratings</p><ul class=product-record__attribute-ratings-list><li class=rating-list-item><p>Ease of Use</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4.5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Comfort</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>3.5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Performance</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4.5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li></ul><p><strong>What We Love:</strong> We experienced minimal shedding when using this brush.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love: </strong>The teeth are too widely spaced to help form curls, rendering this tool better for detangling than styling.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-9 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">If you’re looking for a lightweight yet sturdy brush that doesn’t cost much money, this one from tgin is an excellent option. Though labeled for defining and styling, we found that it functioned best as a detangling brush because it effectively smoothed out our knots and separated our curls without much effort or shedding. During this process the stiff (but gentle) plastic bristles <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>provided a calming scalp massage</a>. By the time we finished brushing we only found one strand stuck in the bristles. When it came to styling, this brush quickly separated curls, but didn’t help define them due to the widely spaced bristles.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-10 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">While there aren’t any bells and whistles with this brush, we ultimately consider it a reliable, well-made tool that will fit into most budgets.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-11 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Bristle Material:</strong> Plastic | <strong>Curl Pattern</strong>: All types</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-splurge-mason-pearson-junior-bristle--nylon-mixture-brush></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Splurge</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Mason Pearson Junior Bristle & Nylon Mixture Brush</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Mason Pearson Junior Bristle &amp;amp; Nylon Mixture Brush" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/UHGJcXQKdrMOEd6iKHbKmM38lX0=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/mason-pearson-junior-bristle--nylon-mixture-brush-ae1965922b3e436ba6d9ff276e692308.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Saks Fifth Avenune</p></span><p>Our Ratings</p><ul class=product-record__attribute-ratings-list><li class=rating-list-item><p>Ease of Use</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Comfort</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Performance</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4.7</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li></ul><p><strong>What We Love:</strong> Though we’re prone to tangles, this brush got rid of knots without any snagging or ripping.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love: </strong>Given the splurge-worthy price, it’s surprising that the handle is made of plastic.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-15 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">At first glance, $200 seemed like an excessive amount to spend on a hair brush, but one pass of the luxurious boar bristle tool through our 3B hair was enough to convince us that this was worth the steep price tag. Before we even ran it through our hair, we enjoyed how the lightweight, ergonomic handle fit into our hands — it set us up for one of the most pleasant detangling experiences of our life.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-16 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">The combination of boar hair and nylon felt invigorating on our scalp, and as we worked our way down, it effortlessly glided through our hair. Our strands are constantly tangled, resulting in shedding and painful brushing, but we didn’t notice any snagging during that first run through. The brush quickly and gently smoothed out our hair without disrupting our curl pattern, leaving it soft and damage-free.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-17 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">When it came to the brush’s overall performance, we had no complaints. We were a bit disappointed to discover the handle was made of plastic, but considering the bristles are extremely high quality, we can overlook the less-than-luxe base.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-18 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Bristle Material:</strong> Boar bristle, nylon | <strong>Curl Pattern: </strong>2A to 3B</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-detangling-tangle-teezer-the-ultimate-detangler></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Detangling</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Tangle Teezer Ultimate Detangler</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Tangle Teezer The Ultimate Detangler" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/pkoA5Kala4VLIauGob7_VlgQniM=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/tangle-teezer-the-ultimate-detangler-92a82fbb6829459eb12c7cf8fc73a4e8.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Nordstrom</p></span><p>Our Ratings</p><ul class=product-record__attribute-ratings-list><li class=rating-list-item><p>Ease of Use</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4.5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Comfort</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Performance</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4.8</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li></ul><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>These flexible bristles feature a patented two-tier design for targeted detangling.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love: </strong>The grip was a bit slippery.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-22 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">We’ve been searching for a detangling brush that doesn’t snag or rip our hair for years. It took a lot of trial and error, but we finally found one that makes the painstaking task actually enjoyable. With its two tier bristle system, The Ultimate Detangler from Tangle Teezer passed through our thick hair with efficiency and comfort, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>resulting in a smooth, frizz-free mane</a>.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-23 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">With its flexible design, this brush was created for optimum use on wet strands. It distributed conditioner evenly and detangled even the thickest of curls in one to two passes. Though the plastic handle was a little slippery, it was significantly quicker to work through our entire head with the Tangle Teezer, and it created much less shedding than the existing brush we’d been using at home.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-24 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Offered in three sizes (mini, regular, and large), we consider the large to be most effective, while still portable enough for daily use. The design felt lightweight and ergonomic in our hand and smoothly contoured to the shape of our curls as we brushed along. Our curl pattern remained intact without any added frizz, too — a serious win.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-25 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Bristle Material:</strong> Plastic | <strong>Curl Pattern: </strong>All Types</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-for-wavy-hair-crown-affair-the-brush-no-002></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best for Wavy Hair</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Crown Affair The Brush No. 002</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Crown Affair The Brush No. 002" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/xTdMMG5tzvcDa_OpW3OKb8SQd3w=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/goop-ea20ea5239dc49f19d7dc01469b5d3fb.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Goop</p></span><p>Our Ratings</p><ul class=product-record__attribute-ratings-list><li class=rating-list-item><p>Ease of Use</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Comfort</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Performance</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4.3</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li></ul><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>The wooden bristles felt incredible on our scalp, providing a soothing massage and an effective detangling experience in one.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love: </strong>Our brush arrived with a missing bristle, which isn’t ideal at this price point.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-29 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">In our Lab test, this brush’s wide-spaced wooden bristles worked best on <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>wavy hair</a> and looser curls. It efficiently glided through our wavy hair’s knots and styled our dry strands without much effort.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-30 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">The handle felt smooth and comfortable to hold without being slippery, and the light pressure created a soothing massage effect. The brush moved through our tangles faster, more seamlessly, and with far less tension than others we’ve tried in the past. Plus, we were impressed by how the tool also functioned as a static reducer, leaving our strands frizz-free and perfectly smooth.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-31 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Meanwhile, we’d be remiss not to mention that the brush’s luxe minimalist design, which deserves to be displayed on all vanities.

Our fine, thin strands tend to get extremely tangled, and we were pleasantly surprised by how smooth our hair felt post-brushing. We attribute this to the brush’s customization options, which allowed us to add and remove bristles to flexibly accommodate our detangling needs and styling preferences.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-37 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">While using the brush, our curl pattern stayed beautifully intact, which is something we’ve struggled with in other brushes.

They felt very soft, yet firm enough to move through large knots with ease. Our tangles came undone with just a single pass, minimizing the length of our wash day routine and leaving our curls smooth and defined. With each additional pass, we noticed our coils clumping in groups, creating a nice volumized look that even enhanced our natural curl pattern.

While the bristles were noticeably firm, we didn’t feel any pulling or tugging as we detangled our thick strands, and we appreciated how little shedding occurred compared to our normal routine. The flexible pad design also contoured to our hair as it moved along our head, a feature that helped distribute product evenly.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-51 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Beyond the bristles themselves, we were quick to notice the brush’s ergonomic handle: It felt distinctly comfortable and stable in our hands. The shape of the brush head was also unique compared to other options we tried. It widens towards the top into an angle, which made it ideal for working through large sections of hair. Targeting sections along the hairline was another story. We found it hard to grab specific strands without accidentally picking up more hair than we’d intended.

During testing, we found ourselves actually using less conditioner than usual because the brush helped distribute product more evenly and efficiently. It contoured to our hair as it glided through each strand, detangling every knot without much work.

The narrow handle felt a little unnatural to hold, but the matte finish made it grippy enough to maneuver comfortably. As for those ball tipped bristles, they created a soothing massage that didn’t get stuck in our strands or cause extra tangling. Post test, we decided that we actually preferred this tool over the popular Tangle Teezer and Denman versions, as it enhanced our natural curl pattern by shaping our coils into soft corkscrews, something those popular brushes have never been able to do.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-64 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Bristle Material:</strong> Nylon | <strong>Curl Pattern: </strong>All types</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-65 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-image--instyle commerce-sc-block-image--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>InStyle / Jessica Juliao</p></span></figure><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-for-wet-hair-drybar-super-lemon-drop-detangling-brush></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best for Wet Hair</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Drybar Super Lemon Drop Detangling Brush</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Drybar Super Lemon Drop Detangling Brush" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/WzunPQ1DhhnREcJCJEapPJ3xap0=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/drybar-super-lemon-drop-detangling-brush-2a8cc216296e42a9a05faa56189fb3cd.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Sephora</p></span><p>Our Ratings</p><ul class=product-record__attribute-ratings-list><li class=rating-list-item><p>Ease of Use</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4.5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Comfort</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Performance</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li></ul><p><strong>What We Love:</strong> The yellow color brought happy vibes to our bathroom counter.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love: </strong>Because of the density of bristles, it's not the easiest brush to clean.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-68 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">The Drybar Lemon Drop Brush glided through our wet hair like silk, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>forming well-defined curls</a> along the way.

When used on wet hair, we were able to shape our curls into our desired coiliness for the perfect wash and go air dry routine.

If your tresses are thick or long, she recommends a larger brush with wider surface area, like the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="nofollow nocaes">Tangle Teezer The Ultimate Detangler</a>, since it’ll detangle faster.

Ultimately, brush size matters less than bristle type and really comes down to personal needs.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-8 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--instyle commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Bristle Type</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-9 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Different bristle types will drastically alter the outcome of your hair styling, which is why it’s important to pick one that’s right for your needs. According to curly hair stylist and Curlventure founder Robert Nieves, there’s a brush for every curl type. “If you want to blow dry curly hair, boar bristles are the best fit — they help distribute the hair’s natural oils, which gives you a healthy shine,” he says. “Wide tooth combs are great for styling — I personally use plastic ones that have some bend and movement to them. But, a paddle brush with ball tipped nylon bristles is my go-to for detangling. It runs product through the hair most evenly and causes the least amount of breakage.”</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-10 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--instyle commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Your Curl Pattern</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-11 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">According to Taylor, not every brush designed for curly hair will work on all curl patterns. “Those with 2A to 2C curls should use a wide tooth comb or a brush with widely spaced bristles to ensure product is distributed evenly and the hair is easily detangled without disrupting the natural curl pattern,” she explains. We’re particularly fond of the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow nocaes">Ouidad Made for Curls Customizable Detangler</a> for its customizable design that works exceptionally well 2A to 2C curls and fine hair.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-12 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">“For those with 3A to 3C curl type, a brush with a mix of wide and narrow bristles will help define curls and detangle without causing too much frizz,” Taylor continues. The <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">Briogeo Vegan Boar Bristle Hair Brush</a> is our pick for this curl pattern because of its varying bristles. Finally, “those with 4A to 4C curl type [should look for] natural bristles, as these types of brushes help to detangle and smooth coily hair. Type 4 hair can also be detangled with fingers, which some people prefer for more control.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-13 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">If you’re still not sure, Taylor suggests meeting with your hairdresser to have them assess what kind of brush would benefit you most.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-your-questions-answered></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-14 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-heading--instyle commerce-sc-block-heading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Your Questions, Answered</span></h2><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-15 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--instyle commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Do you need a special brush for curly hair?</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-16 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Just as you'd need the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>best shampoo for wavy hair</a> or the right styling product for your curls, you need the right brush, too. “Using a specialized brush meant for curly hair types helps reduce breakage and frizz, defines curls, and improves overall hair health,” says Taylor. Brushes with boar bristles and paddle style tools are known to perform well on curls and have a cult-like following within the natural hair community.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-17 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Because a lot of curly haired people prefer to brush their hair wet, it can be useful to seek out a wet brush that is designed for in shower use, like the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">Drybar Super Lemon Drop Detangling Brush</a>. “Curly hair can be delicate and it is important to find a brush that is gentle on your strands,” adds Taylor. The health of your curls will determine how soft, bouncy, and radiant they look, so it’s worth the investment in a high quality brush.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-18 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--instyle commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Are boar bristle brushes good for curly hair?</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-19 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Boar bristles are a great option for curly hair. “Because of the boar brush’s natural bristles, they’re gentle on both the scalp and hair,” explains Taylor. They’re great at distributing oils from the scalp to the roots of the hair, helping to keep curls hydrated and frizz-free. If you prefer styling your curls into slicked back buns or ponytails, boar bristles will also keep your edges and flyaways smooth and set.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-20 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">“I wouldn’t necessarily recommend a boar brush for someone with type 4 hair, as they’re not super effective at detangling coils,” Taylor clarifies. Nieves agrees. He finds boar bristle brushes ideal for styling wavy or looser curl patterns, while mixed bristle brushes are great for thick hair, and nylon bristle brushes are advised for the heavy duty detangling of coarse textures.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-21 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--instyle commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>How do you brush curly hair without it getting frizzy?</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-22 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">To combat frizz entirely, you’ll want to brush curls in the shower with conditioner or while hair is still soaked. “The conditioner allows the brush to glide through the hair smoothly with little to no breakage,” explains Nieves. He also notes that it’s best to start the detangling process from the bottom and work your way up to the roots for the most protective method.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-23 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Taylor recommends brushing hair in sections with a leave-in conditioner like <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">NatureLab.
