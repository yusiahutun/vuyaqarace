While everyone else was off at their costume parties over the weekend, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>Heidi Klum</a> was busy preparing for her annual, and iconic, Halloween bash. The way she prepares? By posting a nude selfie, of course.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">On Sunday, the star shared a snap to Instagram that captured her lying on her back across a fuzzy pink couch with nothing on. Her legs dangled over the arm of the loveseat while her arms crossed over her chest and her blonde hair was fanned around her face.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_5-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"The Calm before the storm," she captioned the post. "3 days to #heidihalloween2023." And as if we had any doubt in her abilities to curate legendary costumes she wrote, "My Motto this Halloween GO BIG OR GO HOME ðŸ¥³."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_11-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">There's never been a year in recent memory when Klum hasn't gone "big" for the holiday. She most notoriously dressed as a giant, realistic-looking worm last year and has also been a creepy alien lady, Jessica Rabbit, and Fiona from Shrek (among many others). Her husband, Tom Kaulitz, also joins in the fun and has been the fisherman to her worm, the Shrek to her Fiona, and the bloodied astronaut to her alien, because couples that Halloween together stay together.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_13-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"My husband is very good, I have to say," Klum praised Kaulitz in a recent interview with <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>People</a>. "Just being there with me, for me, with all of the shenanigans, because I take it up a notch on Halloween."</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_15-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Getty Images</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_16-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Elsewhere in the interview, Klum teased her 2023 costume, saying that this year's look has been especially difficult to create. "I have had a really hard time. Things were going wrong, things were not working out,"&nbsp;she said before adding that she almost canceled Halloween altogether.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_18-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"I was like, maybe I just don't come at all and you pretend I'm there because I was already like, oh my God, this is not working out," she said. "I have no plan B, so I can't come. I have to call in sick that day."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_20-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">But thankfully, Halloween junkies can rest (in peace) knowing that the star will not be missing her annual star-studded bash. "Now I'm positive again," she said. "It's going to work,"&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrSrbClnV6YvK57x56gnaFdoLm2uYynrJ2dXaiyrbLInmShmZyhvLixxKdkqZmiqcZufo9ramZwY22BdH6Q</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 DashJ - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
