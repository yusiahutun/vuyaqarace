Chyna shared a video on her <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Instagram Story</a> of her hairdo, which is just a bit longer than a crew cut and features a completely shaved undercut on the lower half of her head. “New cut baby,” she captioned the clip, which was taken from the styling chair of Los Angeles-based hairstyling company, <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Hairstylist of La L.L.C</a>. See her fresh cut below, and her previous hairstyles further down in the article.</p><p id=content-paragraph-5>Just last month, Chyna was rocking a short, but curly ‘do in a selfie video she shared on April 18, as seen below. Her adorable haircut featured some curls that hung slightly over her forehead and gave off Betty Boop vibes. She was certainly feeling confident in the video, in which she donned a pink crop top and posed for the camera. “Talk to me nice,” she captioned the post.</p><p id=content-paragraph-8>And of course, fans know that the <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>mother of two</a> loves playing with her style and often chooses to model super-long wigs, too.
