Take, for example, the Kardashians. But Frisella’s narrative is really different and very interesting.</p><h2>Is He Rich Because of Social Media?</h2><p>“Every day, we’d walk to every surrounding business, shake hands with the owners and employees in the store, and I’d say, ‘Hey, my name is Andy, and I own Supplement Superstores down the road.'”</p><p>This is how the entrepreneur describes his marketing strategy prior to the introduction of social media. First, he would welcome individuals and encourage them to sample his goods.</p><p>Andy Frisella saw how everyone was uploading photographs of their protein powder on social media, but he claimed in an interview with Forbes that he wanted to do something “different,” so he concentrated on the motivating part rather than the lifestyle.</p><p>Frisella performed the same thing he did before, talking to people one on one, but this time he used his personal and brand accounts to engage with the digital public.</p><p>As a result, it increased brand and consumer trust.</p><p>“We’ve even had folks get our logo tattooed.” That’s the kind of thing that shows us we’re not just selling health products; we’re also creating a space where people feel like they belong.”</p><p>Said the 37-year-old entrepreneur, reflecting on how his marketing expertise has aided the brand’s growth.</p><p>Surprisingly, they never had to undertake any digital marketing as a result of their strategies, and the CEO of 1st Phorm also disclosed that they did not begin putting their hands in that field until 2017.</p><p>Over two decades ago, he and his business partner, Chris, founded Supplement Superstores and then added 1st Phorm and Paradise Distribution for a total of $12,000. By 2015, their company’s revenue had surpassed $100 million, and it was expected to reach $150 million by 2017.</p><p>Personalities With Entrepreneur Partners: Is Amy Willerton, a beautiful actress, happily dating her entrepreneur boyfriend and engaged? As of today, it is clear that the investor has a sizable and remarkable net worth, which he spends lavishly.</p><p>Being an author and public consultant contributes significantly to his enormous net worth. He recently bought a house with his wife for $1.79 million in 2019 and has an excellent automobile collection.</p><p>Yes! The charmer does have a wife who has been his rock during his worst days.</p><h2>Across Thick And Thin</h2><p>“From the moment I met him, I knew he was special and unique.” He was broke, with $70,000 in credit card debt, but he spoke with energy and a vision of tremendous things, no matter how difficult things were at the time.</p><p>On Andy’s birthday, his wife, Emily Frisella, expressed her feelings. Emily uploaded a family photo with Andy Frisella and their fur baby on July 9, 2019, along with a few words for her husband.</p><p>She went on to say how caring the CEO is about other individuals and his buddies. Finally, Emily ends her romantic email by expressing her appreciation for being his wife and having a furry family together.</p><p>“When life offers you lemons, squeeze the most out of them,” the 37-year-old has always lived by, and as he continues to do so and expand his brand, it will be exciting to watch where he will take his business and his life in the future.</p><p>Also Read, <a href=#>Charlie Bigelow</a>, <a href=#>Shura Baryshnikov</a>, and <a href=#>Tara Perry</a>.</p><span class=tag-title>Related tags :</span> <span class="tags-links clearfix"><a href=# rel=tag>Entreprenuer</a></span> <a href=#></a><h3 class=small-font><a href=#>All You Need To Know About Emily Bargeron “Making the Cut’s”?</a></h3>Emily Bargeron was one of the competitors that showed her creations at the competition.
