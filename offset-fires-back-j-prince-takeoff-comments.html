And the truth of the matter is, one can dance and different things in front of all these cameras and all that other shit.</p><p>“When in reality, the truth of the matter is, you wasn’t really there with TakeOff when he was alive. So for you to take the positions that you taking … I’ma just say this to you, don’t ever put me in no position where I have to defend myself. That wouldn’t be healthy for you.
