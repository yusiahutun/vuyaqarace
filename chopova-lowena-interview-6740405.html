Everywhere you look, fashion lovers seem to be channeling outfits you’d likely find on a boarding school campus, breaking out their platform loafers, crisp button-downs, and, of course, all things plaid.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Yet, while school days of the '90s would have you shopping for gear in the junior section of J.C. Penney, the grown-up alternatives have designer labels. Among the most covetable is <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Chopova Lowena</a>, which produces grungy, colorblocked <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>pleated skirts</a> that have an impressive celebrity fanbase, including the likes of <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=3>Dua Lipa</a>, Willow Smith, Charli XCX, Maggie Rogers, and even <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=4>Madonna</a>.</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_7-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-text>Charli XCX wearing a Chopova Lowena skirt.</span> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Getty Images</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_8-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Chopova Lowena</a> was founded by BFF duo, Emma Chopova and Laura Lowena back in 2017, following the pair’s graduation from Central Saint Martins Fashion MA program.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_10-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“We met in the Central Saint Martins BA in 2011 and became close friends bonding over a mutual love for traditional clothing and craft,” the designers tell InStyle over email. “Following our BA, we went on to do the Central Saint Martins Fashion MA as a duo.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_14-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Flash forward to 2022 and the designers have several collections under their belt, with products ranging from <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>tops</a> to <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2>dresses</a>, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=3>swimwear</a>, and, of course, those sought-after <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=4>skirts</a>.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_16-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“We have always loved skirts,” the duo says of their most popular piece to date. “We were always obsessed with finding a new exciting skirt when we were younger and when we were doing the MA we focused on skirts a lot. The carabiner skirt came about through a lot of development and diving into our heritage and sportswear.”</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_18-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-text>Laura Lowena and Emma Chopova.</span> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Getty Images</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_19-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Each of the label’s unique designs is heavily influenced by Chopova’s Bulgarian background (she lived in Sofia, Bulgaria until the age of seven, when she moved to New Jersey) and Lowena’s English roots. They describe their aesthetic as a “juxtaposition of folkloric and sportswear references” with an emphasis on upcycling of vintage and deadstock textiles.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_21-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“Our aesthetic comes from who we are, everything from our heritages, our experiences of growing up to our love of obscure sports,” the founders explain, adding that “sustainability, upcycling, utilizing recycled fiber and organic fibers fabrics” are the core values of our brand. “We aim to give new life to vintage traditional textiles but also a new context, make craft modern and showcase its beauty.”</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_23-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-text>Chopova Lowena's Spring 2023 fashion show.</span> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Getty Images</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_24-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">To set their product apart from the rest, Chopova and Lowena incorporate metal hardware contrasted with various textiles, including folkloric aprons and tapestries, wool, taffeta, and cotton. Their embroidered skirts are hand-mended by Chopova’s mom “to preserve all the beautiful pieces of cloth” and then stitched together to ensure every little piece serves a purpose. Their Fall 2022 collection includes knitted pieces inspired by traditional knitted socks and blankets, while plenty of quirky graphics, mixed prints, puff sleeves, and embellishments appeared on the brand's Spring 2023 runway.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_28-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">As for how to style these eclectic pieces, the internet is riddled with inspiration. For example, Dua Lipa rocked <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>the brand’s signature pleat in pink, black, and blue</a>, and paired the mini with a white puff-sleeve button-up blouse. Madonna had a slightly different take, wearing <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>the label’s butterfly print skirt from their SS22 collection</a> with a white belt, fishnet tights, red leather gloves, and a sheer lace bodysuit.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_30-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">No matter how fans style their clothes, Chopova and Lowena hope the pieces help wearers feel “a little more like themselves” and find the fun in fashion through their work.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_32-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“Our favorite part is seeing everyone in the clothes through social media. It’s so amazing to see every individual take on making a piece of clothing their own!”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrSrbClnV6YvK57wqGmqaemlnqtu9aepZplmaPBpr7VopywZWZsgXGAj24%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 DashJ - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
