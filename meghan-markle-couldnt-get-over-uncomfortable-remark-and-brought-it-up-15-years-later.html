The actress has faced harsh remarks from the people around her when growing up, and one comment stayed with her for several years.</strong></p><p>According to Andrew Morton’s biography,&nbsp;Meghan: A Hollywood Princess, the former <a href=#>TV</a> star couldn’t get over one encounter. The 42-year-old comes from a family of ‘low-level creatives’ who already had a footing in <a href=#>Hollywood</a>, trying to live an ‘offbeat life’ in the sunshine. Following the American dream, <a href=#>Meghan Markle</a> went to Northwestern University to study international affairs and theater. She was also the first person in her family to go to college. But her experience at college was bittersweet.</p><figure class="wp-block-grvmedia-grv-video GRVMultiVideo"></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-meghan-markle-couldn-t-get-over-uncomfortable-remark>Meghan Markle couldn’t get over ‘uncomfortable’ remark</h2><p>Meghan Markle has openly talked about the discrimination she faced due to her dual heritage. <a href=#>Royal</a> author Morton writes about one incident in particular that Meghan recalled in her 2015 <a href=# rel=nofollow>essay</a> for Elle.</p><p>The Duchess of Sussex attended Northwestern University, where she ‘stood out’. She was one of the few five percent of the student body who was African American.</p><p>But her experience turned bitter near the beginning when her dorm mate in the first semester made a harsh remark.</p><p>She recalled the uncomfortable experience sharing: “Navigating closed-mindedness to the tune of a dorm mate I met my first week at university who asked if my parents were still together.</p><p>“‘You said your mom is black and your dad is white, right?’ she said. I smiled meekly, waiting for what could possibly come out of her pursed lips next. ‘And they’re divorced?’ I nodded. ‘Oh, well that makes sense.”</p><p>The interaction felt like a stab to Meghan. Morton explains: “The snide remark cut her deeply. ‘Makes sense how?’ she wondered. Of course, she understood the implication: that the failure of an interracial marriage was inevitable. The interaction stayed with her and was one of the memories she referred to years.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-meghan-talks-about-swallowing-her-voice>Meghan talks about ‘swallowing’ her voice</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.celebritytidbit.com/uploads/39/2023/10/GettyImages-1041091264-1024x683.jpg><p>Meghan is known as an outspoken <a href=#>celebrity</a> who does not fear voicing her opinion and telling her true story to the world. But the royal member and wife of <a href=#>Prince Harry</a> also has a past where she felt ‘stifled.’</p><p>“I was scared to open this Pandora’s box of discrimination, so I sat stifled, swallowing my voice,” she wrote about her college experience.</p><p>The Duchess also revealed witnessing her mom tearing up as someone hurled a racist slur against her in LA when Meghan Markle came back from college during a break.</p><p>Meghan recounted the aftermath of the insult: “We were leaving a concert, and she wasn’t pulling out of a parking space quickly enough for another driver.</p><p>“My skin rushed with heat as I looked to my mom. Her eyes welling with hateful tears, I could only breathe out a whisper of words, so hushed they were barely audible: ‘It’s OK, Mommy.”</p><p>Related Topics</p><p>MORE CELEBRITY STORIES</p><span></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuwaqwwaKrZ5ufonxzfJFsZmpoX2Z%2FcLnEoJ%2Bapl2irrO3y55knKelobGvwIygnK1ln6uys3nUp5qopZakv7WtwaWcZqqVoq6zt4yapZ1lkqe8trPHrWSirF2qvW59lGawnpmiqHqtrdOeqWg%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 DashJ - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
