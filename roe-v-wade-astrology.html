Wade</a> is more relevant than ever. On the morning of June 24, 2022, it was revealed that the Roe v. Wade ruling of 1973 is in jeopardy yet again, proving that <a href=# id=auto-tag_abortion data-tag=abortion>abortion</a> accessibility continues to be a controversial issue in the United States. After 50 years of protections at the federal level, Roe v. Wade has officially been overturned.</p><p class=p2>The freedom to make decisions about your own body will always be worth fighting for. And without Roe v. Wade, that fight to protect your right to bodily autonomy will inevitably become much harder. As someone who is both pro-choice and a professional astrologer, it’s my duty to analyze the astrological chart of Roe v. Wade to see where the struggle for legalized abortion is headed. What I found was shocking, to say the least.</p><p>Related Stories</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/askawitch10main_FI.png> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/askawitch9mainFI.jpg><p class=p2>However, news that Roe v. Wade has been overturned was not entirely surprising. After all, it documents from the Supreme Court were leaked as of May 2, 2022, during the <a href=#>pre-shadow phase of Mercury retrograde</a>, revealing their intentions to overturn. Luckily, with the confusion of Mercury retrograde involved, this likely means this isn’t the end-all, be-all for abortion in the United States. Trust me, there’s still plenty of information that will continue to arise! Like many of the Supreme Court justices have said, there is still a lot of work that needs to be done in formulating the structure of the laws. There may also be a lot of additional details added to the ruling in the upcoming months ahead. Because this transpired at <a href=#>an inauspicious time</a>, there will hopefully be room for change.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/abortion-protest.jpg><p><span>Let’s take a look at the astrological timing of the initial ruling of Roe v. Wade. The event took place on January 22, 1973 at 10:00 a.m. in Washington, DC. Because this event happened while the sun was in revolutionary Aquarius, it’s clear this decision was a major milestone for human rights in the United States. The moon was also in passionate Scorpio, the <a href=# id=auto-tag_zodiac data-tag=zodiac>zodiac</a> sign of deep and transformative change. Scorpio is also the zodiac sign of karma, making this decision something that was always meant to happen.</span></p><p><span>Venus is the planet of women and femininity in <a href=# id=auto-tag_astrology data-tag=astrology>astrology</a>. When <a href=#>Roe v. Wade was signed</a>, Venus was in rigid Capricorn, symbolizing the government’s outdated attitude toward a decision that challenged the status quo; a status quo that endures to this day. In Roe v. Wade’s chart, Venus was also moving through the the tenth house of authority, making it clear that the judges were the ones in charge. Because the tenth house also represents all that is seen by the public, this emphasizes the fact that the whole world was watching and waiting to see how the United States would decide.</span></p><figure class=wp-block-pullquote readability=1.5><p>T<span>he future of abortion rights in the U.S. will likely reach some form of a resolution by the lunar eclipse in Taurus on November 8.</span></p></figure><p><span>In astrology, Neptune is the planet that rules over the reproductive organs. In Roe v. Wade’s event chart, Neptune was moving through the ninth house of legal affairs, adding confusion to the decision-making of the courts. Basically, Sagittarius is a wild and untamed zodiac sign, making it difficult to ascertain where the legal boundaries should be drawn. And let’s be real—how do you draw boundaries for the human body?</span></p><p><span>The event chart for Roe v. Wade is currently being put under the microscope by the transiting Neptune as it heightens the need to resolve the issue as soon as possible. In this chart, the tenth house of reputation is being galvanized by Pluto in Capricorn, making it even more difficult to the judges to be on the same page.</span></p><p><span>Looking back at the astrology of 2022, the conversation surrounding the overturn of Roe v. Wade began while Venus was retrograding through Capricorn, back in January. This inevitably brought Roe v. Wade back to the forefront of our cultural consciousness, because Roe v. Wade was literally signed while Venus was in Capricorn. This reveals that there is still unfinished business surrounding Roe v. Wade that needs to be settled once and for all.</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/AP21335525942926.jpg><p><span>Something else to note about Roe v. Wade—the moon was in Scorpio, which was aligned with the South Node of Destiny at the time it was passed. This indicates that it will be hard for the Supreme Court to make *all* of the radical changes to the landmark decision that they want to. There will be lots of details added to the ruling, but not as much as the judges may have wanted to. Their hesitancy is mostly due to fear of a negative reaction from the masses! Because the world-changing <a href=#>total lunar eclipse in Scorpio</a> on May 15 ignited the conversation about Roe v. Wade, the future of abortion rights in the U.S. will likely reach some form of a resolution by the the <a href=#>lunar eclipse in Taurus</a> on November 8.</span></p><p><span>Don’t lose hope just yet, because there will be many opportunities and ways for the people of the U.S. to protest anti-abortion laws and make their voices heard. Because Pluto—the modern planetary ruler of Scorpio—will station retrograde from April 29 to October 8 in Roe v. Wade’s 10th house of public concern, you can rest assured that the blowback will be immense.</span></p><figure class=wp-block-pullquote readability=1><p>There will be many roadblocks standing in the Supreme Court’s way.</p></figure><p><span>Mars—the traditional planetary ruler of Scorpio—will begin its three-month retrograde on October 30. This retrograde will take place in Roe v. Wade’s third house of communication while opposing its natal Neptune, which will bring up several frustrations the legal process. Basically, it’s my astrological opinion that it will be nearly impossible for the government to fully <a href=#>do away with abortion rights</a> in the United States. There will be many roadblocks standing in the Supreme Court’s way and a reversal of fortune that could happen when Mars stations direct on January 12, 2023, making it even harder for them to commit to overturning Roe v. Wade and <a href=#>abolishing abortion rights</a>.</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/AP18022830537122.jpg><p>In the morning of June 24, 2022 the Supreme Court ruled that Roe v. Wade would be overturned. When this decision was announced, the moon was in Taurus, and not making any major astrological aspects. Being that the Taurus moon is in line with the North Node of Destiny,&nbsp; the elements of faith and religion in the ongoing battle for woman’s rights are at play. Taurus is a feminine sign that represents fertility and rules that define fertility. Therefore, this announcement is right in line with the astrology of the current moment.</p><p>Uranus, which is the planet of rebellion, will form a connection with the moon later in the evening of June 24. You can expect protests to ensue in the coming days, as the majority of the public is deeply unhappy with the news. Both of these aspects will be triggered on July 31, when there is an exact conjunction between the North Node of Destiny and Uranus. This could ultimately signify a reversal of some kind, as this planetary alignment can bring a lot of shakeups to the U.S. government in the coming months.</p><p>Neptune, which happens to be in Pisces, will station retrograde on June 28. Neptune represents the reproductive organs, which is why it’s important to note that there is a lot of ambiguity and confusion over whether or not this dramatic decision that has been recently made will remain for the long haul. Because of this coming retrograde, and also, the fact that Neptune is currently moving through its pre-retrograde degrees, there could be some alterations made to this ruling that give more protection for women’s and abortion rights.</p><h2><a href=#><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/SC-newsletter-banner-.jpeg alt="newsletter banner" width=670 height=315 sizes="(max-width: 670px) 100vw, 670px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a></h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmirpK65pq%2FArKueql6YvK57xKernqqklravucSnq2ibpaHBtr7EaGhrbmZrgXF70aicZq5drK6lsYyaqq2qn6G8qMWO</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 DashJ - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
