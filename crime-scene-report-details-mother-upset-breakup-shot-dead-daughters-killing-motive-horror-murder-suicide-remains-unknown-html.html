report.</span></p><p><span>At one point during the fight, police were called to the scene, and Mr Johnson eventually decided to move out of the house.</span></p><p><span>He left the premises just after 4pm on January 13, but continued exchanging text messages with Ramsdell-Oliva for several hours.</span></p><p><span>The woman eventually stopped responding and also blocked her now ex-fiancé from her Facebook page.</span></p><p><span>The woman's sister would later tell police that she communicated with Ramsdell-Oliva via text messages until about 6pm that night. That was the last time she heard from her.</span></p><p><span>Michael Johnson turned up at their Syracuse home at around 9.30am accompanied by his family, who volunteered to help him move his belongings to Layton.</span></p><p><span>The man and his relatives spent hours inside the house packing his possessions, unaware that Ramsdell-Oliva and her two daughters’ bodies were lying inside her locked bedroom.</span></p><p><span>Mr Johnson late told officers that he knocked on the door several times asking Ramsdell-Oliva to move her car, but no response came.</span></p><img id=i-9a660e24 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2014/01/15/article-2540109-1AB056B700000578-31_306x423.jpg height=423 width=306 alt="Too young: Ramsdell-Oliva's 13-year-old daughter Kenadee (pictured) was one of the victims.
