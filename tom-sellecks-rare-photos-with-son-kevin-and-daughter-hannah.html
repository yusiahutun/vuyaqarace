But no matter how much publicity and praise his showbiz career garnered, the <a href=#>Emmy</a> winner has continued to choose his family over fame. Tom is the loving husband of his wife, <a href=#><strong>Jillie Mack</strong></a>, and the doting father of <a href=#>his two kids</a>, <strong>Kevin Selleck</strong> and <strong>Hannah Selleck</strong>, whom he’s been pictured with on rare occasions over the years.</p><p>The <a href=#>Friends</a> alum shares his son with his first wife, <strong>Jacqueline Ray</strong>, whom he was married to from 1971 to 1982. Kevin was born in 1966 at the time Jacqueline was in a different relationship, but Tom became his dad when he adopted him in August 1987.</p><p>After the <a href=#>Blue Bloods</a> star and Jacqueline went their separate ways, he met his second spouse, Jillie, and the two were married in 1987. Tom and the <a href=#>ER</a> actress expanded the television icon’s family when they welcomed their daughter, Hannah, the following year in 1988.</p><p>Throughout the years, Tom gave some rare glimpses inside his life as a dad as Kevin and Hannah joined him at a few red carpet events. But because the 3 Men and a Baby actor is a “fairly private person,” he yearned to raise his kids in a more normal setting. Tom quit Magnum P.I. at the height of his fame so he could focus on his family.</p><p>“I quit Magnum, not because I didn’t like it or I was tired of it,” Tom told <a href=#>People</a> in April 2020. “I was tired from it. And I wanted a three-dimensional life because I didn’t have one.”</p><p>After coming to the decision to retreat from the limelight, the actor moved to a rural ranch in Ventura, California, where he still lives to this day. On the property, Tom and Jillie have more than 1,500 native avocado trees. “I do grunt work and I make the rounds. I like watching things grow. It’s a retreat,” he gushed.</p><p>Tom ultimately returned to showbiz after a few years, and since then, he’s continued to star in films and TV shows to this day, including Blue Bloods. However, the <a href=#>Golden Globe</a> winner will never let his career get in the way of his wife and children.</p><p>“I’ve always treasured the balance between work and time with my family,” the proud dad gushed to the outlet. “It’s always about them.”</p><p><strong>Scroll through the gallery below to see Tom’s rare family photos!</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLjOrJyrr5WauK3FjZympmegpMC1v46tpqZlo5q5rbHCpKpmqpGnsm68x6irqKtdrLa1tIyspqdlm5rDqrqMmqWdZZSWwqi0056pZqCRo7uitI4%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 DashJ - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
