The two share five children.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-10 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The former couple has seemingly moved on, however, with Palin telling the Post Todd now "spends his time with his girlfriend whom he's had for some time now."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-12 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The former Republican vice presidential nominee, meanwhile, has her own new relationship with 64-year-old Duguay, who was previously married to supermodel Kim Alexis.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-14 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Palin told the Post that that the relationship was sparked when she called Duguay, an old friend, to seek advice about <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="noreferrer noopener">her defamation trial against The New York Times</a>. (She sued the paper for libl, over a past editorial that falsely linked her political group's statements to a mass shooting.)</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-16 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">While the suit was ultimately dismissed (a federal judge said Palin failed to prove the Times acted with "actual malice"), her relationship with Duguay — which she described to the Post as "safe and comfortable" — blossomed.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-18 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Amid the trial, Duguay acted as something of a New York guide, she added. "On my free time, he would walk all over New York and he would show me what he and the Rangers did back in the day, or at least where they did it."</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-20 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-text>From left: Ron Duguay and Sarah Palin arriving to her defamation trial against The New York Times.</span> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner>J Mayer/Shutterstock</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-21 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Elsewhere in the interview, Palin told the Post: "Ron is the first person that I've ever even talked to about a lot of this personal stuff. So it's been helpful and refreshing to have Ron to talk to about not just politics, because he's got more common sense in his little finger than the collective in DC, but just about life."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-23 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Duguay has also been along for the ride for Palin's latest venture: a run for Congress.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-25 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Earlier this month, the ex-Alaska governor announced that she is running for Congress, joining the pool of <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="noreferrer noopener">dozens of candidates</a> hoping to fill the seat held for decades by Rep. <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>Don Young</a>, who died in March.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-27 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"Today I'm announcing my candidacy for the U.S. House seat representing Alaska," Palin, who has already earned an early boost in in a very crowded field from former President <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Donald Trump</a>, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel=noopener>said in a statement</a>. "Public service is a calling, and I would be honored to represent the men and women of Alaska in Congress, just as Rep. Young did for 49 years. I realize that I have very big shoes to fill, and I plan to honor Rep. Young's legacy by offering myself up in the name of service to the state he loved and fought for, because I share that passion for Alaska and the United States of America."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-31 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">A special primary election for her state's only seat in the House of Representatives is scheduled for June 11, followed by a general election on Aug. 16.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-33 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Speaking to the Post, Palin said Duguay — who she called "really handsome" — was with her in Alaska while she worked on the campaign: "He came to help me get my yard and property in order because he knows how busy I am with bustling down the campaign."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-35 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">This is Palin's first bid for office since she left politics in 2009 when she resigned as governor of Alaska; she was previously the mayor of Wasilla. She publicly weighed a run for president in 2012 but decided against it.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiolaS9rbGNnKamZ6CkuarAyJyqaKuRp66pec%2Bao6KmXaS9prrSZqypZZGXvLbAjKecsGWcpMOmecCnm2aokZ67brvFZpuirp%2BnsKZ5xJqpraBdqLWiwNOeqaKml2Q%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 DashJ - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
