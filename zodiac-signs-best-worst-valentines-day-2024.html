And while romance is available to all, certain <a href=#>zodiac signs will have the best </a><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>Valentine’s</a><a href=#> Day</a>—while others will have the worst. If your zodiac sign happens to fall under the latter category, don’t worry. The stars always have a say, but V-Day has nothing to do with astrology anyway. You can always make your own magic.</p><p>Even though Valentine’s Day is brimming with heart-shaped candy and bright red roses, the holiday <a href=#>can be rather </a><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>polarizing</a>. While Valentine’s Day is a chance to celebrate your relationship and give your boo some extra lovin’, it often leaves those of us who are living the single life feeling left out. If you’re feeling pressured into pairing up, tune that noise out! Single or not, February 14 is the holiday of love—and the only right way to celebrate it is by spreading love everywhere you go.</p><p>This upcoming Valentine’s Day will be one of the most interesting we’ve experienced in years. After all, <a href=#>Mars—planet of passion </a><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>and</a><a href=#> sex</a>—will be joining forces <a href=#>with </a><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>Pluto</a><a href=#> in Aquarius</a> for the first time in this lifetime. This will intensify our primal instincts and emotions, provoking arguments and plenty of makeup sex. The moon will also be moving through Taurus—the zodiac sign of its exaltation—while joining forces with <a href=#>Jupiter, planet of joy </a><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>and</a><a href=#> expansion</a>. This is sure to increase the desire for sensual connection, as well as lead to a big conclusion to something that may have already begun. Is someone ready to admit their feelings for you? Or perhaps that their feelings have changed?</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/astrologynewslettersignup.png><p><span>Curious to see if the stars have anything to say about Cupid’s favorite holiday?

Venus—planet of love and luxury—is still moving through Capricorn, which enhances your beauty, lovability, and the odds that your flirtatious will be reciprocated. You’ll have no problem finding a date on February 14, if that’s what you’re looking for. And as if that wasn’t enough of a reason to enjoy yourself, keep in mind that the Taurus moon will also be moving through your fifth house of pleasure and fun, urging you to express yourself and explore your romantic side. <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>Read your full monthly horoscope here.</a></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=zodiac-signs-who-will-have-the-worst-valentine-s-day>Zodiac Signs Who Will Have the Worst Valentine’s Day</h2></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=1.4189189189189><h2>Virgo</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/zodiacbannerday_virgo.png><p>Unfortunately, you might be dealing with an influx of work or stress during Valentine’s Day. With Mars joining forces with Pluto in your sixth house of health and routine, there’s a strong chance you could feel so overwhelmed with other priorities that you don’t even have time to enjoy yourself! However, this is also a powerful opportunity to set your priorities straight, especially if you have a lover or a friend you want to express your desires to on Valentine’s Day. Just because you might not be in the mood for a romantic dinner doesn’t mean you can’t share the love through acts of service. <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>Read your full monthly horoscope here.</a></p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=2.8385269121813><h2>Pisces</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/zodiacbannerday_pisces.png><p>You might feel more like self-isolating than socializing on Valentine’s Day. After all, the sun, Mercury, and Mars will all be surging through your 12th house of solitude and self-reflection, which could bring up fears and anxieties that make it difficult to connect with others. Remember, Valentine’s Day is just a holiday and it can come and go with no pressure at all. However, if you don’t want to miss out on the heart-shaped festivities, then put your phone on “do not disturb” and plan a rom-com marathon at home or invite a lover over for an extra discreet day of low-key activities on the couch. <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>Read your full monthly horoscope here.</a></p></li></ul><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmirpK65pq%2FArKueql6YvK57y6Kqratfr7yltcCcZKyhl6PAbq7ErKtmr5%2BnwLV51Zqjnqaknrumv4ydmLJlYmV%2FdXs%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 DashJ - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
