The new trailer for the latest&nbsp;James Bond&nbsp;flick&nbsp;No Time To Die premiered on Wednesday September 1, and it showed the first glimpse into the 33-year-old actress’s debut as the first female 007 agent. The latest film in the nearly 60-year-old film franchise is historic not only to have the first Black woman take up the 007 mantle, but it will also be&nbsp;<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Daniel Craig’s</strong></a> final film in the spy franchise.</p><p id=content-paragraph-3>The new trailer was loaded with action-packed scenes of Daniel’s Bond beating up bad guys and doing death-defying stunts. Of course, there were plenty of other 007 trademarks, like the 52-year-old actor rocking a dapper tuxedo, and him seducing beautiful women, like&nbsp;<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Léa Seydoux’s</strong></a> Madeleinne Swann. Lashana’s character, Nomi, showed up briefly about halfway through the trailer, but she really shined by the end. She was first shown sitting shotgun in a car. At the end of the trailer, she hopped in and flew a jet with Bond in tow. Of course, the trailer ended with a classic shot (pun intended) of James Bond firing a pistol right at the camera.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Lashana-Lynch-007-shutter-embed-1.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-4>Besides Lashana, Daniel, and Léa, the trailer also showed off&nbsp;<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Rami Malek’s</strong></a> <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>new villain</a> Lyutsifer Safin.&nbsp;<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Ralph Fiennes</strong> </a>(M),&nbsp;<strong>Ben Whishaw&nbsp;</strong>(Q), and&nbsp;<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Ana de Armas&nbsp;</strong></a>(Paloma) were also featured in the trailer, which also teased that it would be Daniel’s last time playing the iconic secret agent. The words: “Nothing can prepare you for the epic conclusion” flashed across the screen, before the trailer ended.&nbsp;No Time To Die will <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>hit theaters</a> on October 8, after being delayed multiple times due to the COVID-19 pandemic.</p><p id=content-paragraph-5><a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>No Time To Die</a>&nbsp;is historic for the&nbsp;James Bond&nbsp;franchise, not only because it will be Daniel’s last time in the role, but also being the first time a Black woman has taken on the role of 007. Unfortunately, some fans sent her <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>abusive messages</a> and comments, because they were angry that she was playing the role. “I am one Black woman — if it were another Black woman cast in the role, it would have been the same conversation, she would have got the same attacks, the same abuse,” she told&nbsp;Harper’s Bazaar&nbsp;in a November 2020 interview, where she said that she’d deleted her social media due to the attacks.</p><p id=content-paragraph-6>&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGhpaWphZH16e49qZqenXam2rrGMraZmnJmaerW%2BwKKjnqpdm7azv9NmnZ6lkaGybnyPcGY%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 DashJ - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
