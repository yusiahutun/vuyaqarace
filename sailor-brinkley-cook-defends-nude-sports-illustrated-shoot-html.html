I’d die on the inside. We are women and we are human. We have stretch marks. We have rolls. We have cellulite. That’s all part of our bodies.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'We become so obsessed with our exterior message; we give no thoughts to what’s in our heads,' she added.

That’s an underlying thread that exists throughout the Swimsuit Issue,' she said.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'You have Harvard graduates, you have billion-dollar moguls, you have philanthropists, you have teachers, you have mothers—you have a full range of women represented in the alumnus of this magazine, and not one of them failed because they wore a bikini.'&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font></p><h3 class=mol-factbox-title>READ SAILOR'S FULL POST</h3><p class=mol-para-with-font>Okay I know long captions are scary but I need to say something publicly and it's important.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Hearing the backlash towards the In Her Own Words project hurts my heart. To know that we are in a world where if a woman chooses to embrace her body, strip nude and pose powerfully she is being told she is objectifying herself makes me not only uncomfortable but makes me really feel the need to say what I'm about to say.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>This project, for me and for the other girls who CHOSE to participate, was about TAKING OUR POWER BACK.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>In an industry where it is rare for models to have a say in the content they are being used to create, having total self control and creative control during the IHOW shoot was true and unbridled self empowerment.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>This project was a very emotional, long road, spanned over a year. And I was on every one of the shoots.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>When a girl came in to shoot it was a real experience, it wasn’t on a time limit and it didn’t have corporate heads you didn’t know the name of screaming to “get the shot!” It was a group of women working together to create something special for the world and most importantly themselves.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Models/athletes/PEOPLE chose to do this. They did not get told to do this. If someone did not want to shoot that day and felt too emotional, she would come back the next day after we all grabbed some coffee and talked about it. If someone backed out, all good, we understood how emotional it can be to strip yourself of not only clothes but an armor we all put up from exterior criticism.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>This project had the intention of showing women feeling POWERFUL in who they are. That’s that. I grew up hating my body and myself thus creating a overlying insecurity felt throughout my teen years. Doing this project helped me turn a leaf in my confidence and insecurity. I feel sexy I feel secure I feel badass I feel like I can pose naked and be respected just as much as anyone else.
