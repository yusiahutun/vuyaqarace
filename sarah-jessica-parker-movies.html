Not only has she been happily married to <strong><a href=#>Matthew Broderick</a></strong> since 1997, the two of them becoming parents to one son and twin daughters, but Sarah has been working consistently as an actress for the past 43 years. That is no easy feat to accomplish, but given the films she continues to make, and the fact that she stars on HBO’s Divorce (the network that launched her biggest hit, <a href=#>Sex and the City</a>), there’s no indication of her slowing down whatsoever. Oh, and as if all of that wasn’t enough, she’s also the winner of four <a href=#>Golden Globe Awards</a>, two <a href=#>Emmy Awards</a> and two <a href=#>Screen Actors Guild Awards</a>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.closerweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/sarah-jessica-parker-mickey-mouse.jpg><p>Born on March 25, 1965, in Nelsonville, Ohio, Sarah made her <a href=#>Broadway</a> debut in a 1976 revival of&nbsp;The Innocents at the age of 11, followed three years later by the lead in&nbsp;Annie. The film roles started not long after that, as did guest starring on television shows, miniseries and TV movies. In the ’80s, she scored her first starring gig on a television show in the form of Square Pegs, in the ’90s, it was the iconic Carrie Bradshaw on Sex and the City, and currently the previously-mentioned Divorce. And in between, there have been all of those films.</p><p>To celebrate the fact that Sarah has turned 54, we’re taking a look back at some of her key roles from over the years.&nbsp;<strong>Just scroll down to relive the memories.&nbsp;</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLjOrJyrr5WauK3FjZympmegpMC1v46smKuZmGK3pr%2FSopqaZaCWv6yx0WakqK6ZmsBw</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 DashJ - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
