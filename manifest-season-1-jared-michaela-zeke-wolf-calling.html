Jared has been in love with Michaela (Melissa Roxburgh) for years but when she was about to leave for Jamaica his proposal of marriage to Michaela was deemed inappropriate since Michaela was unsure about it. However, when Michaela returned after almost five and a half years (although for her it was only a week), along with the other passengers of Montego Air Flight 828, she discovered that Jared was already married to her best friend, Lourdes (Victoria Cartagena).</p><p>Jared tried to make it up to Michaela. Their situation was already quite complicated since he had assumed that the passengers of the plane were dead, and it was time he moved on. However, the plane returning changed everything, and as much as Jared tried to get back to Michaela his marriage with Lourdes would always come in the way. For a good part of the first half of Season 1, Jared tried to wrap his head around the fact that Michaela was following orders from the voices in her head, that she referred to as "Callings". Over the course of the show, the two managed to develop a partnership at work but it soon got intimate when Jared and Michaela finally confessed that they were still in love.&nbsp;</p><p>As expected, Jared's love for Michaela was rekindled but this time, things began to take a different turn. With Zeke (Matt Long) coming in, who has a lot more in common with Michaela as they are both receiving the "Callings", it didn't take much time for Jared to immediately turn envious about their companionship. In the finale, however, he crossed the line as he trespassed into Zeke's property only to give Michaela a substantial proof of Zeke's criminal records. This move was unexpected of Jared, who is a detective and should be aware of the discreet nature of his work. However, Jared acted like a complete fool and his emotions took the best of him and left behind the worst impression. Fans, who have been rooting for Jared and Michaela so long, are also disturbed by the way Jared has been reacting.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/d6ehjqrqtzoun.cloudfront.net/38299bde-d2f5-46c2-af97-22ba27c82146.jpg><p>In fact, fans are claiming that the wolf whose "Calling" Cal (Jack Messina) and Zeke had received in Episode 14, was actually Jared. In the "Calling" that both Cal and Zeke had received, they encountered a wolf which leapt at them the moment they saw them in the eye. Jared almost did the same thing with Zeke, and according to the drawing that Cal had made, the wolf attacks Michaela. We did hear a gunshot in the finale episode, and by the looks of it, it did seem that Michaela was shot in the brawl between Jared and Zeke. One fan on <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Reddit</a> has claimed, "why do I think it's Jared? Well, a big part of it is the wolf in sheep's clothing parable. We all thought Jared was a good guy. He was trusted and helped the survivors. But when Zeke was introduced he became controlling and jealous. He allowed his jealous to boil over into a rage that had him attacking Zeke which ultimately led to the gunshot in Mick's apartment just as Mick walked in."</p><p dir=ltr lang=en>I think depending on whether Jared got injured or not I think it’s going to be pretty rocky between Michaela and Jared. Especially if she or Zeke were the ones injured. I feel like she may take time from Zeke and Jared.</p>— - hollie - (@xhollie_sealeyx) <a href=#>March 4, 2019</a><p class=end-of-block-quote>&nbsp;</p><p>We had also seen a glimpse of the wolf when Michaela was trying to disperse the crowd in Time Square, where Griffin met with his final moment. It was at this time when Jared- who had been given the task of keeping everything under order- was completely distracted by a small conversation between Michael and Zeke. Immediately after this scene, we witness Jared barging into Zeke's apartment just the way Zeke had seen it in his "Calling". A fan pointed this out, and claimed, "In the calling he was alone at the apartment and opened the door where the wolf was standing. Jared barging in Ep 16 happened in the same way."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/d6ehjqrqtzoun.cloudfront.net/e7e04322-dd14-499b-a449-b4249d7e024c.jpg><p>So is our good boy Jared turning into a bad boy because he could not get the sweetheart he had been rooting for so long? Hopefully, the question will be answered whenever the show returns for a Season 2. Coming from creator Jeff Rake, 'Manifest' has been following the aftermath of the sudden re-appearance of Montego Air Flight 828 which mysteriously went missing for almost five and a half years.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmillZbEuHrCqKRopZGjtqex0q1krJ2RqLyveZBmoZqqlZl6rrXCoZiepJFix6a3xGauqKSWYrCiuMuipaA%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 DashJ - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
