of rejections.'&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Landing 56 interviews, he gradually became more and more comfortable with speaking to hiring managers and taking subsequent technical assessments - with such assessments being standard for those looking to get hired in computer-science positions.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'I feel much less nervous and familiar with the process. Additionally, I know what to expect, and the areas which I need to improve at,' he reflected to Newsweek.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>The second he got the acceptance note from Ford, it 'felt like a massive weight had been lifted off my shoulders,' he said.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'I was in class at the time and I remember stepping out, going into the hallway and jumping up and down while silently screaming in excitement for around 10 minutes,' he said.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'I ended up landing two more offers, but ultimately accepted Ford.'</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Sharing his top piece of advice with Newsweek, Oliver recommended hopefuls 'network' as much as possible.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'A big mistake I made was not networking properly and being scared to network and relying on cold applications instead.
