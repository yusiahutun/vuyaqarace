The Stranger Things star took to Instagram to post a picture of them both embracing, and simply wrote: "World Cancer Day," with a star emoji. She also tagged the Olivia Hope Foundation charity's Instagram page. Millie had met Olivia before she passed away, and the pair became friends. Millie's beauty brand, Florence by Mills, supports the Olivia Hope Foundation, which works to help end childhood cancer, and was founded in honour of Olivia after her passing.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/96082b7362a5-millie-bobby-brown-heartbreaking-tribute-z.jpg><p id=eJO5a6mez9y7 data-wc=17><strong>Millie Bobby Brown shared a&nbsp;heartbreaking tribute to her late friend Olivia Hope on World Cancer Day</strong></p><p id=eZ8k6gUg3m4D data-wc=1><strong>MORE: </strong><a class=hm-link href=#>Kylie Jenner reveals how she's protecting daughter Stormi in new interview</a></p><p id=e1RXb9AuB4i2 data-wc=116>Millie previously opened up about how Olivia's illness and death had shaped her as a person, as it taught her to be grateful for everything she had. Talking to Glamour in 2019, she said: "A few years ago, I met a young girl, her name was Olivia Hope LoRusso. She had been diagnosed with cancer and I got friends with her for a while. We then became best friends and we spoke every day. And then she sadly passed away. I'm best friends with her sisters, her twin sister, her family â€“ we're very close. In my new beauty and skincare line called Florence by Mills, we have a dedicated 'in memory of' product about Olivia."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/4725015fb2c0-millie-bobby-brown-florence-by-mils-z.jpg><p id=e_kYKSsTu7hc data-wc=14><strong>Millie's beauty brand, Florence by Mils, helps raise money for the Olivia Hope Foundation</strong></p><p id=eIZl6m6lDUoV data-wc=1><strong>READ: </strong><a class=hm-link href=#>Princess Charlotte is taking after mum Kate Middleton, reveals dad Prince William</a></p><p id=e2vb8T7Yd82j data-wc=78>The star continued: "I think that's probably one of the biggest things that shaped me as a person because it genuinely made me look around and be grateful for everything I have, and made me grateful for not only my family but life itself, being young and really embracing everything you've got in this current moment. And then also trying to help other people. So I think that was probably one of the biggest shape shifters for me."</p><p id=ezU6eDB5q0Aw data-wc=104>Florence by Mills has a special Love Liv Eyeshadow Palette which has been created in honour of Olivia. The product description on the website reads: "Mills created this limited-edition palette in memory of her friend Liv, who passed away after a fight with paediatric cancer. This palette contains five wearable shadows in soft, creamy hues inspired by Liv. The velvety powder shadow blends easily and delivers high-pigment payoff perfect for everyday makeup play. We will donate $75,000 of the proceeds from the Love Liv Eyeshadow Palette to the Olivia Hope Foundation, which continues to support Liv's dream of finding a cure for childhood cancers."</p><p id=eBZH41-lbay_ data-wc=14><strong>Like this story?<a class=hm-link href=#> Sign up to our newsletter</a> to get other stories like this delivered straight to your inbox.</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbHLpaammZeWx6q6xGeaqKVfmLKtscGroK2hlah8c3yRaWdraGVtgXR8j2ikoqScnrJurs6bmbJlkqe8uLqMramimqWpsm60xJqprZqimq6stc2gZJ2dkam1bsPOq6OdZZOWu6Sx0WabmrFf</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 DashJ - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
