Are you also carrying your library card, gym membership card, insurance card, a business card of someone you met at happy hour months ago, a punch card for that smoothie place from your old neighborhood, and who knows how many receipts in your wallet too? It’s time to pare it down.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-1 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">A credit card holder, which forces you (in the nicest of ways!) to keep just what you need on you, is the minimalist’s version of an overstuffed wallet. We’re slowly becoming a cashless society where you can pay for more and more purchases on your smartphone, so consider a slim credit card case to be one step towards the future. Whether you choose one in a lush leather, cool pattern, or bright hue that you could spot from any corner of your purse doesn’t matter. As long as it securely holds your essentials in a style that you adore and a price point you’re comfortable with, it’s a winner.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-2 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Along with the help of a few stylists and designers, we narrowed down the best credit card holders.

Its timeless design earns it the top place on our list, though its card slots, both on the interior and one on the exterior, ensure it’s perfectly modern, working how the everyday woman needs her card case to. The pin-snap closure ensures your cards aren’t going anywhere, and the exterior pocket oh-so brilliantly holds your most used credit card.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-3 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">While it’s on the thick side when it comes to credit card holders, that allows it to perform more like a mini wallet, housing cash, coat check numbers, and other little pieces of paper you come across while out and about.

In that case, you can stuff it full of your cards and keep the ones you reach for most often in the slit pocket on the interior. Others may need this to double as an Airpod case or become a spot to house ear plugs when heading to a concert. Schreiber has her eye on the poppy or cognac versions for fall, but any of the five color options are all-year-long appropriate.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-9 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size: </strong>3.75 inches high x 2.75 inches wide | <strong>Card Slots: </strong>10+ | <strong>Material: </strong>Leather</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-splurge-bottega-veneta-credit-card-case></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Splurge</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Bottega Veneta Credit Card Case</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Bottega Veneta Credit Card Case" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/wB7-ajOd1OkQqq50DhO2bpIvLC8=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/bottega-6a6fe1d6d9614183b7e86c5931117872.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Bottega Veneta</p></span><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Love</span> <span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Don’t Love</span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-12 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">If <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>you’re looking to throw down serious cash</a> on a credit card case you’ll use next week, next year, and next decade, this Bottega Veneta design gets our vote. It balances fun and functional, with a classic design that will both keep your cards safe and will make you smile every time you reach into your purse. We’re suckers for their colorful hues, like the lavender and grass green tones (called wisteria and parakeet), but the brand offers this design in a collection of always-in-style neutrals too.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-13 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Its price is nothing to sniff at, but if you commit to loving and using it, well, forever — since it will last that long, promise! — spending more may be worth it.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-14 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size: </strong>3 inches high x 4.5 inches wide x .2 inches deep | <strong>Card Slots: </strong>Three, plus a pocket | <strong>Material: </strong>Leather</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-colors-acne-studios-folded-leather-card-holder></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Colors</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Acne Studios Folded Leather Card Holder</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=817 data-sizes=750px alt="Acne Studios Folded Leather Card Holder" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/JF0d77flI3d4xEYHyVBvQ751Fyc=/fit-in/1500x817/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Acne-Studios-Folded-Leather-Card-Holder-c103b7985ad34712b35bb9ee0db0b5d7.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Acne Studios</p></span><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Love</span> <span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Don’t Love</span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-18 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">No more digging in your purse <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>wondering where your credit card holder is</a>.

Some have zippers, some have snaps, and some have no closure at all, simply relying on a precise design that creates a tight fit so your cards won’t slip out. Decide what’s best for you, and ensure that you feel comfortable with the quality of the closure before trusting the holder to house your most important cards.&nbsp;</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-3 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--instyle commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Material&nbsp;</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-4 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Credit card holders get put through the ringer, whether in your purse, pocket, or when set onto your dining room table when a glass of red wine goes awry. (Oops!) Leather is always a good choice. It’s tough, resistant to wear and tear, and develops a beautiful patina over time. Other textiles can work too, but beware of stains, as they can be tricky to wash. You never know when a lipstick will lose its cap in your purse.&nbsp;</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-5 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--instyle commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Fit&nbsp;</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-6 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Not only does a credit card holder need to fit, well, your credit cards, but your purse and lifestyle in general. Do you want a credit card holder with slots that your cards can slip into just so? Or would you prefer a pouch where there is plenty of room, but they aren’t snuggled in tight? In general, credit card holders are slim and likely to fit into any purse, but double check that you’ll have a home for it —&nbsp;maybe zipped into a inside pocket of your purse for peace of mind —&nbsp;before purchasing.<br></p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-your-questions-answered></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-7 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-heading--instyle commerce-sc-block-heading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Your Questions, Answered</span></h2><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-8 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--instyle commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Is it safe to use a credit card holder instead of a wallet?</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-9 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Safe? Definitely. Sometimes, a credit card holder is even more safe than a wallet, considering how durable they are. Not only that, but they force you to become a credit card minimalist, keeping only your most important cards on you, so if you lose it or (heaven forbid) it gets stolen, you’re not starting from scratch.&nbsp;</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-10 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--instyle commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Why should I use a credit card holder instead of a wallet?</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-11 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">There are a couple reasons you may want to retire your seen-better-days wallet in favor of a credit card holder. First, you can’t deny how appealing the size is. Credit card holders are significantly slimmer than wallets, so you can save yourself the unnecessary bulk. That opens up space in your purse and may allow you to downsize your purse. Your shoulder will thank you.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-12 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">There’s no getting around needing to swipe a credit card or flash your driver’s license almost every time you leave home. Modern life requires cards of all kinds, but if you don’t keep cash or change on you, using a credit card holder instead of a wallet simply makes more sense. That way you can pare down your necessities to just your most important cards, leaving behind that punch card you haven’t used since 2017 and crumpled-up receipts.&nbsp;</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-why-shop-with-us></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-13 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-heading--instyle commerce-sc-block-heading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Why Shop With Us</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-14 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Megan McCarty</a> is a full-time freelance writer who writes about everything from design, to beauty to fashion.
