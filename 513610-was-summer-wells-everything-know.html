She went down to check but did not find her. Unfortunately, more than two years down the line, nothing substantial has been unearthed.</p><h2>Were there investigations into Summer Wells' disappearance?</h2><p class=align-left>Summer’s case took the country by storm. It inspired state and volunteer search efforts and an ongoing investigation. She was<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener"> first reported missing</a> to the Tennessee Bureau of Investigation (TBI). Because of a concern for the child’s safety, they issued Endangered Child Alert.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/f0d3c51b792f10e8.jpg><p class=align-left>A day later, authorities issued an Amber Alert on Summer’s behalf.

Tennessee Bureau of Investigation's officials asked for information on a truck that had been seen in the area when Summer disappeared.</p><p class=align-left>It was claimed that the red Toyota Tacoma had a full-bed ladder rack with white buckets in the bed. The driver was sought as a potential witness, and the TBI stressed the driver was not a suspect but may have been able to provide information. However, the identity of the driver of the truck remains unknown.</p><h2>Did they ever find Summer Wells?</h2><p class=align-left>Despite numerous leads and tips submitted early in the investigation, Summer is still missing, and her Amber Alert remains active.<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener"> Investigation agents revealed </a>that the circumstances leading up to Summer's disappearance remain unclear.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/ba7c212abb8c9659.png></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Was Susan Powell ever found?
