Submissions should not exceed 400 words, and must include your full name and address, plus a phone number for verificationNo matter where you live, you have probably experienced the frustration of a long wait at clinics or hospitals, especially during long weekends. With the growing prevalence of <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">artificial intelligence</span></a>, the question naturally arises: can AI take on some medical consultation responsibilities, thereby curtailing wait times?The debate often centres on whether AI <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">can emulate</span></a> the empathy, intuition and human connection provided by skilled healthcare providers. The reality, however, is that the fleeting moments we share with our doctors during most consultations often prove inadequate for forging meaningful connections.<p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The doctor-patient relationship, meant to be a sacred bond, has been compromised by the demands of efficiency. It is therefore somewhat paradoxical to discuss whether AI could replace an aspect of healthcare that, in many instances, has already dwindled to a near absence.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">If the human touch were to be utterly extinguished, it might be advantageous to patients. An overlooked aspect of the AI in healthcare debate is the potential for AI’s dispassionate algorithms to provide a sanctuary where patients can freely share their complete personal narratives. Just as people now turn to Google for answers to their most embarrassing and intimate questions, AI could offer a space for patients to discuss their symptoms, habits and concerns without the fear of judgment often felt under the human gaze.</p>Despite the promise AI holds, unresolved ethical dilemmas and issues of accountability suggest that full reliance on AI for medical counsel is still premature and inadvisable. The <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">doctors’ strike</span></a> in South Korea is a reminder that the medical field, steeped in tradition, has long found adapting to change challenging. Implementing reforms in such a complex system requires careful consideration and a gradual approach.<p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">It would be more pragmatic at this moment to view AI as a complementary tool. Just as the introduction of X-rays and MRIs revolutionised diagnosis and treatment, AI has the potential to transform the medical landscape.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Rob Yau, Kennedy Town</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1">More digitisation needed to improve efficiency</h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">To complement big plans to enhance Hong Kong business competitiveness, there are some government and business processes that can be improved so that efficiency is enhanced in line with our competitors.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">First, more can be done to promote the use of e-signatures. Some government departments, financial institutions, legal processes and others still insist on wet signatures for documents, incurring wastage of time and sometimes money. We must do more to popularise the use of e-signatures – perhaps enhanced through the iAM Smart platform – for government and legal documents as much as possible.</p>Second, we must simplify the address proof process. While the government offers a <a rel=nofollow class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">centralised service</span></a> for some departments, others are not covered by it and neither are banks and other important organisations. Why can’t we have a centralised organisation where one can update one’s address for all departments? It would be even better if this service could be linked to financial and other organisations too, saving everyone time, cost, paper and frustration, and improving efficiency and accuracy.<p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Then there’s property conveyancing. The buying and selling of property involves lawyers reviewing all the historical documents, the so-called title deeds. These get thicker as they change hands. Some places that follow the common law system, such as Singapore and the United Kingdom, now have a digital title deed system. Why can’t Hong Kong follow suit and ditch a legacy system that benefits those with vested interests?</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Having pages of physical documents to sign is only damaging our once-vaunted efficiency and causing us to lag behind others. We need a bold mindset to remain competitive.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Freeing up those engaged in mundane work would enable the redirection of human resources to areas experiencing manpower shortage, like healthcare and education.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The government could consider setting up an independent task force to collect feedback, design and implement changes, and encourage the regulatory bodies and the business community to follow suit.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Edward Lee, Wong Chuk Hang</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1">Estate manager’s efficiency sets commendable example</h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">From the restroom window of my apartment, I can see the restroom of the unit opposite. One day, a strong stench alerted me to the bursting of the sewage pipe of the opposite unit. However, the owner of that flat was unwilling to address the problem immediately due to financial issues.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Concerned about the impact on my family’s health, I requested the assistance of Ms Li, the manager of my housing estate, who immediately took action. She sent people to the opposite unit to conduct repairs and also dispatched a team to disinfect my restroom.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The workers who arrived wore blue protective suits and carried out thorough cleaning and disinfection. I was impressed by their professionalism.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Afterwards, I wrote a commendation letter to the management company, praising Ms Li for her prompt action and the professionalism of her team. Ms Li was promoted to regional manager.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">This incident made me think. In Hong Kong, the government’s efficiency is often questioned, and many issues, such as that of subdivided flats, remain unresolved. However, during this small incident, I witnessed the high efficiency and sense of responsibility demonstrated by my housing estate manager and her team.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">If the government could solve livelihood issues with such speed and efficiency, it would be a blessing for all of us.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">David Chan, Yau Ma Tei</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tK%2FMqWWcp51kvLG1zaKmp2ecmsG1sdGsZpqqpJ6wrbGObGlvaGdpgnCtyKxknaGjpa60v8iopZqslWK0osbEZpqorZyZeqOxjKOsrKxdrLWiwIydppysn6d6sL7DnqmenA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 DashJ - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
