I’m okay with it though,” Syd joked.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-50>“Oh yeah, you’re fine. You’re not worried about how it’s going to affect you,” his wife replies.

Then, in a later episode of season 4, they addressed being pregnant with their third child.</p><p>Studio McGee posted on March 18, 2021, on their <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Facebook</a> that they would begin filming season 3. However, season 4 showed the progression of some builds and therefore Shea was still pregnant when these were shot.</p><p>It can take Shea and Syd months to complete a remodel. The Netflix show’s season 4 description reads: “Along the way, Shea and Syd invite viewers into their lives as they raise daughters Wren, Ivy, and new baby Margot.”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Watching the new season of <a href=#>#dreamhomemakeover</a> and these spaces and homes are so gorgeous.
