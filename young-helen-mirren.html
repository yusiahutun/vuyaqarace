Her incredible performances have earned her an Oscar, three Emmys, five SAG Awards, a Tony and more, making her one award away from earning the title of EGOT.</p><p>But Helen says her latest role, playing the title character in the film <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Golda</a> (which hits theaters August 25th), the prime minister of Israel who faced with the potential of her country’s complete destruction in 1973, has been one of her most memorable to date.</p><p class=inline-stn-player></p><p>“I felt closely entwined with Meir during filming, I would think about that acting thing: <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">am I becoming her or is she becoming me?</a> I’ve never done anything like that before.&nbsp;It was an adventure,” Helen told DuJour Magazine. “I got so used to being that person in the daytime that when the makeup all came off and I saw myself as I am, I’d forgotten that was what I looked like.”</p><p>Here, we take a joyful walk down memory lane with a look back at young Helen Mirren’s early career and how the 78-year-old became the powerhouse she is today.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Young Helen Mirren’s first love: acting</h2><p>Although she was not born a “Dame”, Helen Lydia Mironoff still has royalty in her blood — her father was a member of an exiled family of the Russian nobility and her great-grandmother was a Countess. Her father Anglicized the family name to “Mirren” when Helen was around 9 years old.</p><p>Growing up in London, England, Helen was attracted to acting at a young age, landing her first role during primary school in Westcliff-on-Sea.

When she was only 18, Mirren passed the audition for the National Youth Theatre and at a mere 20 years of age, she played Cleopatra in their 1965 production of Antony and Cleopatra at the Old Vic, a role she even says in <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">her memoir</a>, “launched my career.”&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.firstforwomen.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/08/young-helen-mirren-2.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Young Helen Mirren taking the stage</h2><p>Most of Helen’s early work was in the theater.&nbsp;Playing Cleopatra provided her an opportunity to join the Royal Shakespeare Company.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.firstforwomen.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/08/young-helen-mirren-3.jpg><p>While at RSC, she played Castiza in the 1966 staging of The Revenger’s Tragedy.&nbsp;One of her coveted roles at the Royal Shakespeare was playing Cressida in Troilus and Cressida (1968), then Julia in The Two Gentlemen of Verona in 1970.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.firstforwomen.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/08/young-helen-mirren-4.jpg><p>She also appeared in four productions between 1965 and 1967 at the Century Theatre at the University Theatre in Manchester.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.firstforwomen.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/08/young-helen-mirren-5.jpg><p>In 1970, a documentary film, Doing Her Own Thing, focused on Mirren’s time with the Royal Shakespeare Company.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.firstforwomen.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/08/young-helen-mirren-6.jpg><p>She then made her way to West End stage in 1975 playing the role of a rock star named Maggie in Teeth ‘n’ Smiles, a musical play.
