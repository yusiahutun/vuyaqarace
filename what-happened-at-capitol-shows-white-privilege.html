And yet, in the case of racism, there are many centuries worth of evidence to prove its existence, but society is still unwilling to address it. Yesterday’s Capitol siege provides us with an undeniable example of the disparity with which white and Black people are treated in similar scenarios. I use the word ‘similar’ loosely, but here we saw white privilege in searingly clear view.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=1 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">On 6 January 2021, angry supporters of Donald Trump stormed the Washington DC Capitol Hill in full-raid mode, thwarting Joe Biden’s Electoral College victory by attacking the building and causing disruptions. Trump declared a muted call for peace after the protests were well in motion but did not urge his mostly maskless supporters to disperse. In a thronged scene, protesters fought past police forces and breached the house, waving American flags as they marched through the hallways like demented Vikings. A woman who was shot inside the Capitol during the marches later died. Biden’s session was swiftly dismissed and lawmakers—including the building’s personnel—were rushed to safety.</p><img data-dynamic-svg=true src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.harpersbazaar.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/play.db7c035.svg?primary=%2523ffffff" data-testid=dynamic-svg-base height=24 width=24 alt="Play Icon" role=img title=Play style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><img alt="preview for Trump mob break into the Capitol" title="Video player poster image" width=2000 height=1000 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/vidthumb/79f3a561-6db0-4317-9d0d-b79b2b9321d5/thumb_640x360_00002_1610019972_81413.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><img alt="capitol protesters" title="Capitol protesters" width=5395 height=3597 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/gettyimages-1230455089.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><a rel=noopener href=# class="pinterest css-1i6sckr e1c1bym14"><img data-dynamic-svg=true src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.harpersbazaar.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/social/pinterest.e8cf655.svg?primary=%2523ffffff" data-testid=dynamic-svg-base height=auto width=auto alt=pinterest style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">ROBERTO SCHMIDT</span></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=5 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The reaction in America has been, as across the rest of the world, condemnatory among the Black community. The common sentiment felt throughout the scenes of “domestic terrorism” was one of deep deflation. When the Black Lives Matter protests took place in June 2020 after George Floyd’s murder, Black protesters faced tear gas, flash grenades and rubber bullets. Many sustained serious injuries. To name just a few cases, as reported on by <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://time.com/5894356/protesters-injured-police/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=Time class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">Time</a>, 21-year-old Dounya Zayer had a seizure after she was pushed to the kerb by police, smacking her head on the floor. She is still recovering from concussion and a back injury caused by her fall. Donavan La Bella, 26, was left with a fractured skull and the bones around his left eye socket were broken, after police shot at him with an impact ammunition. Shantania Love, 30, was blinded by an officer who fired projectiles into a crowd. Yesterday’s protesters were met with little-to-no resistance from the police. In fact, in the midst of the turmoil, some <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://twitter.com/bubbaprog/status/1346920198461419520?s=20" data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="protesters took selfies with law-enforcement officers" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">protesters took selfies with law-enforcement officers</a>. The hypocrisy was dazzling.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=7 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60"><a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/racism-uk-inequality-black-lives-matter-wealth-economic-health-a9567461.html data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Research proves" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">Research proves</a> that, over the last decade, Black people were up to six times more likely to be stopped by police than white people, showing a 38 per cent stop-and-search increment rate between 2018 and 2019. Black people are 10 times more likely to be stopped and searched by police than their white counterparts. This suggests a far higher rate of arrest for Black people than white people, highlighting a disproportionate benchmark of justice. It’s worth remembering this statistic, given how hostile the circumstances were in the wake of the BLM movement. Although we have moved forward since last year’s anti-racism protests, the inertia, fatigue and frustration of the Black community remains the same.</p><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p0"></span>White privilege sits at the heart of racial injustice<span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p1"></span><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=9 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The differing treatment of the police, which we saw so plainly at the Capitol, says a lot about white supremacy. It exemplifies how much racial disparity is engrained in the nation’s system and how white privilege sits at the heart of racial injustice. In times of political strife and social angst, to see the scary reality of racial inequality taken to extreme proportions, look to the US: if Black people were the ones climbing up walls and causing havoc, the consequences would have been far more devastating. More guns would have been fired and the death toll would have been much higher, all at the hands of white power. To put it simply: if you are white and angry you get away with untold crimes, but if you are Black and show a sentiment of anxiety, if you protest for basic human rights, you are demonised.</p><img data-dynamic-svg=true src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.harpersbazaar.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/play.db7c035.svg?primary=%2523ffffff" data-testid=dynamic-svg-base height=24 width=24 alt="Play Icon" role=img title=Play style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><img alt="preview for Protesters demonstrate against death of George Floyd" title="Video player poster image" width=2000 height=1000 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/vidthumb/953a4fae-3846-4bd5-97c7-bba01cc7c662/thumb_1280x720_00001_1591088131_22555.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=11 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">“It's not white privilege, it's just white power concentrated in the annals of all our institutions,” says activist Ericka Hart. “What you're seeing is hardly a coup; this is white nationalism in a white imperialist country built on the enslavement and genocide of Black and Indigenous peoples. Even the terms used to describe them aren't consummate to their actions, such as ‘troublemakers,’ ‘traitors,’ ‘right wing authoritarians,’ anything except white or racist. But if this is a coup and sedition is a punishable offence, why the lack of arrests?”</p><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p0"></span>A single Black child is met more aggressively by police than over a thousand white people walking into the Capitol <span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p1"></span><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=13 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Black organisers in America were arrested and charged for protesting and continue to be shrivelled after having their pictures taken at protests against the extrajudicial killings of Black people by police last summer. “A single Black child is met more aggressively by law enforcement than over a thousand white people walking around the Capitol building, some of them armed,” Hart continues.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=14 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Activist and LGBTQ+ commentator Barrett Pall agrees. “Protestors who stood with the BLM movement were at every stage met with harsh and severe force,” he says, <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/sep/05/nearly-all-black-lives-matter-protests-are-peaceful-despite-trump-narrative-report-finds data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="highlighting that most of the protests were peaceful" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">highlighting that most of the protests were peaceful</a>. “We were named rioters and looters and depicted by President Trump as anarchists looking to cause mayhem. We were and are people protesting for equal human rights. We came together peacefully to protest the double standard that exists for white supremacist in comparison to BIPOC Americans. Tear gas, rubber bullets, dogs, tanks, and other means of excessive force were waiting for us at the beginning of every organised peaceful protest, yet when Trump supporters or white supremacist terrorists come together to riot, they are met with kindness, patience, and almost no resistance.”</p><img alt="washington, dc january 06 a protester yells inside the senate chamber on january 06, 2021 in washington, dc congress held a joint session today to ratify president elect joe biden's 306 232 electoral college win over president donald trump pro trump protesters entered the us capitol building during mass demonstrations in the nation's capital photo by win mcnameegetty images" title="Capitol protesters" width=7765 height=5177 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/capitol-protesters1-1610020716.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><a rel=noopener href=# class="pinterest css-1i6sckr e1c1bym14"><img data-dynamic-svg=true src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.harpersbazaar.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/social/pinterest.e8cf655.svg?primary=%2523ffffff" data-testid=dynamic-svg-base height=auto width=auto alt=pinterest style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Win McNamee</span></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=16 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">What happened at the Capitol building is an embarrassment; it is clear proof of the behavioural and social preferences bestowed on the white community.
