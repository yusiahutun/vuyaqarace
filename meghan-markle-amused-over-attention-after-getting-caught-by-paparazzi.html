The pair went to grab a bite to eat at the Italian restaurant Pane E Vino before shopping at a boutique called Wendy Foster. The two were all smiles and laughing as they enjoyed their time together while ignoring photographers. However, Judi says that Meghan was “amused” by the attention.</p><p>Judi said: “Meghan’s body language rituals as she is ‘caught’ by the cameras here is more delighted and generous C-lister than haughty A-lister.”</p><p><strong>MORE: </strong><a href=#>Meghan Markle teases her Hollywood comeback at glam Red Carpet event</a></p><p>“Typical A-list body language might involve some gracious poses and B-listers tend to prefer the ‘hide’ option, keeping the head right down and a sombre facial expression as though they are no-way courting publicity or recognition.”</p><p>She continued: “Meghan’s friendly smiles suggest she is delighted by the attention, though as she grins with her girlfriend or actually converses with the cameras. For someone so frequently in the public eye and who seemed to be seeking privacy, she looks amused to be getting the recognition here.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-making-friends-with-celebrities>Making friends with celebrities</h2><p>Billionaire Tyler Perry also recently<a href=#> revealed the sweet nickname</a> he has given Lilibet.

He revealed that he sent Meghan and <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Prince Harry</a> a letter before their wedding to tell them that should they ever need any help, he would be there for them and that they could use his house as a refuge.</p><p>“Everybody thought&nbsp;Oprah&nbsp;introduced us, but <a href=#>Oprah [Winfrey]</a> didn’t even know that I reached out to them,” he said. Tyler went on to reveal that it was actually a mutual publicist who introduced the three of them.</p><p>“I sent them a note… and just said, ‘If you ever need anything, I’m here,’ and she called months later and just talked to me like I was a therapist, and we just had a great conversation.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-meghan-s-gratitude>Meghan’s gratitude</h2><p>In the couple’s <a href=#>Netflix</a> documentary Harry & Meghan, the Duchess of Sussex got emotional when talking and the pair’s bond.</p><p>“He [was] like, ‘My house is safe.… You’re going to stay as long as you need,’ And I’m going get you there safely. And I’m gonna keep you there safely until you have somewhere to go,'” said the <a href=#>TV</a> star</p><p>Tyler kept true to his promise as he said: “Every day. Every day that they were there, I looked to see if anything’s happening online. Nothing.
