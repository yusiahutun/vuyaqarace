For the Napiers, Rasberry's, and Nowells, it's the best time to get creative and extend hospitality. Here are some of our favorite ways to celebrate, whether you're spending the 4th of July weekend at home or in our home town!</p><p><strong>1. Make A Splash with A Pool Party</strong><br>For Erin and Ben, the best way to relax and refresh is by jumping into a cold pool with their daughters on a hot afternoon. Good thing their best friends have pools to share. (If you're in town, try visiting the Laurel Sportsplex and Natatorium on HWY 84. Only $4 fee!)</p><p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1800/9573/files/Screen_Shot_2022-06-23_at_2.59.35_PM.png alt style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p><strong>2. Make a Spread with Mississippi's Most Harvested Summer Fruit</strong></p><p>Did you know that Mississippi's watermelons are some of the juiciest and coveted fruits in the south? The best crops are ready around the beginning of July. Take it from us, make a charcuterie spread, slice some watermelon, and you'll win "Independence Party of Year." If that's not a thing, it should be.</p><p>&nbsp;<img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1800/9573/files/491A5983.jpg alt style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><h3></h3><p><strong>3. Attend A Blow-Your-Socks-Off Fireworks Show</strong></p><p>Every year on the 4th of July weekend, a firework show at the Sawmill Square Mall draws hundreds of folks to the heart of downtown, and you can't miss it. On Saturday, July 3rd, at 9:30 pm, bring a lawn chair and watch as the fireworks light up the sky over our beloved City Beautiful. Be sure to get there early to get a good viewing spot!</p><p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1800/9573/files/Screen-Shot-2017-07-03-at-9.37.39-PM.png alt style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>4. Grill Something Special</strong></p><p>Take it from Jim Rasberryâ€” there's nothing more satisfying than cooking up something that people love to eat. Pop by the Knight Butcher in Downtown Laurel to pick up high-quality cuts (the most important part!), All-Purpose Base Coat and seasoning from Scotsman Co. General Store, and you'll be set.</p><p><img src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1800/9573/files/Photo_May_18_9_50_58_PM_jpg.webp?v=1656013476" alt style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>Learn all about Jim Rasberry's grilling tips and secrets <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>!</p><p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1800/9573/files/Untitled_design_1cf3ca70-4eac-4ff9-b69d-98ed158b905b.png alt style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><br>Shop Jim's Favorite <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">All-Purpose Base Coat</a> and Scotsman <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Cutting Boards</a>.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>5. Get Outdoors and Go On A Patriotic Adventure</strong><br>The easiest way to enjoy the 4th of July weekend is to spend time with people you love and explore a new place. Many event venues, museums, and downtown small businesses host holiday-specific events in every town. If you're a local or visiting Laurel for the weekend, take a gander at Landrum's Country Patriotic Day.<br><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1800/9573/files/287685992_5481938818494083_569643700015634989_n.jpg alt style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>Landrum's Country is a recreation of an 1800s settlement in Laurel, Mississippi. This homestead is a family-friendly outing that offers a little bit of everything for everyone. Enjoy the Smokehouse food truck, blacksmith and wood carving demonstrations, and wagon rides. Eat all-you-can-eat homemade ice cream, fresh watermelon, and lemonade. Admission is only 10.00 per person (3 and under are free!)</p><p>There's countless things to do and celebrate on this special weekend.
