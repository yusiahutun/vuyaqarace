Menopausal symptoms vary from person to person, and can be as mild as the odd menopause hot flush or bad night’s sleep or to severe hair loss, brain fog, major joint pain and anger and anxiety. One thing’s for sure, it's an unpredictable ride.&nbsp;</p><p id=eiGiqoxIMW data-wc=59>Thankfully, we’ve become far more educated on the <a class=hm-link href=# rel=noopener>menopause</a> than we were in our mother’s era, with celebrities including <a class=hm-link href=# rel=noopener>Davina McCall</a>, Drew Barrymore and Gwyneth Paltrow being very open – and very real – about their menopausal and perimenopausal symptoms. And as such, we have become savvier about dealing with the symptoms of menopause beyond HRT (Hormone Replacement Therapy).&nbsp;</p><h3 class="factBoxTitleClass_f1xis0ve hm-heading">Top 3 menopause supplements</h3><p id=evQ5LpIJF7 data-wc=32>Lifestyle changes are a big recommendation of the NHS, including regular exercise, relaxing activities like yoga and, a big one - changing your diet, and that’s where menopause supplements come into play.&nbsp;</p><p id=eGFKDuSHuF data-wc=39>Alice Mackintosh, registered Nutritional Therapist at <a class=hm-link href=# rel="noopener nofollow">Equi London</a>, comments: <strong>“By fully supporting your entire body internally via supplements, it can help to balance your hormones, strengthen your immunity, and even improve digestion, plus your ability to cope with stress.”</strong>&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>How does the menopause affect skin?</strong></h2><p id=eWxDXJtmlF data-wc=21>Changes to skin are a regular menopause symptom too, with women finding their skin becoming drier, more acne-prone and rosacea flares.</p><p id=e-aETVQco7 data-wc=72>Kate Kerr, Clinical Facialist and Director of <a class=hm-link href=# rel="noopener nofollow">Kate Kerr London Clinic</a>, explains: <strong>“During perimenopause and the menopause, oestrogen declines quickly and as a result, our skin becomes more dry and less radiant. Oestrogen controls the genes associated with collagen and elastin production, so less oestrogen means a drastic reduction in the production of collagen and elastin, resulting in a decrease in elasticity and firmness and an increase in fine lines and wrinkles.</strong></p><p id=ezu4nWUbcZ data-wc=59><strong>&nbsp;“This is experienced, not just on the face, but all over the body. The lack of oestrogen also causes the skin’s cell turnover to slow down and reduces ceramides (these are lipids that make up 50% of the skin’s protective barrier) and GAGs (glycosaminoglycans – the body’s natural moisturisers), which leads to further dryness and an impaired barrier function.”&nbsp;</strong></p><p id=eobka9Pc0H data-wc=26>Kate continues: <strong>“Dry skin can of course be very itchy, and scratching can cause a rash to develop. At this time, wound healing also slows down.”</strong></p><h2><strong>What are the best menopause supplements?</strong></h2><p id=eix714wQWo data-wc=56>Generally speaking, menopause supplements are a one stop shop to support your body while going through the menopause, both balancing your body, aiding the gut and general health, while dealing with the external symptoms – expect to see ingredients like turmeric, Ashwaghanda Root Extract and Probiotics in many along with B Vitamins, Vitamin C and D.&nbsp;</p><p id=eRngKRFbOm data-wc=39>Some bestselling brands include <span><a class=hm-link href=# rel="sponsored noopener nofollow">LYMA’s menopausal supplements</a></span> have been dubbed the “gold standard of supplements” while Equi London’s menopause formula gets almost five-stars across the board. <span><a class=hm-link href=# rel="sponsored noopener nofollow">JS Health’s menopause supplements</a></span> specifically target night sweats, and <span><a class=hm-link href=# rel="sponsored noopener nofollow">Wellwoman’s</a></span> covers joint health.</p><p id=e6qhz6C-wZ data-wc=22>If you are taking HRT, always check with the manufacturer or your GP if a menopause supplement can be taken alongside it.&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>We’ve done our research to find the top-rated menopause supplements with rave reviews.</strong></h2><ul class="affiliateProductList_a1p8yzmf affiliateProductList_a1p8yzmf--normal" aria-label="Affiliate products list"><li class=affiliateProductListItem_a15uc6c7><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/72423f9d348f-lyma-menopause-supplements.jpg><p><h3 class="affiliateProductName_afobsy4 hm-heading">The LYMA Supplement for Menopause</h3></p><p><strong>Best review:</strong> “Can I just say that this supplement has been MIRACULOUS in helping my menopausal symptoms in ways that I cannot fully describe!
