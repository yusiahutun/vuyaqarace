The season features centennial events that honor the stadium’s rich past and celebrate its future.</p><p>The new season will feature approximately 30 music and comedy performances from an exciting and eclectic mix of some of the biggest names in music and entertainment today, including <strong><a href=#><span>The Strokes</span></a>, <a href=#><span>Duran Duran</span></a>, <a href=#><span>Dave Matthews Band</span></a></strong>,<strong><a href=#><span> Zach Bryan</span></a>, <a href=#><span>Kevin Hart</span></a>,</strong> and more. In addition, the inaugural Head In The Clouds New York Music & Arts Festival returns and <a href=#><span><strong>LL Cool J’s</strong></span></a> Rock The Bells Festival will celebrate the 50th year of hip hop. Lastly, <strong>The New York Pops</strong> – the 78-musician independent pop orchestra will perform with <a href=#><span><strong>Jason Mraz</strong></span></a> as part of the Stadium’s ongoing partnership, which began in 2015.</p><p><strong>Mike Luba, the executive responsible for the stadium’s rehabilitation who produces concerts at the venue in coordination with The Bowery Presents</strong>, says: “It’s hard to believe that it’s coming up on a full decade since we began the renovation of the stadium. We’ve come a long way since that first show with our brothers in arms, Mumford and Sons, who bravely stepped up to play the opening night in 2013. It’s been incredibly rewarding to ride along with the stadium crew, the hundreds of artists, our invaluable community neighbors and partners, and the over 1 million folks who have found their way out to the magic oasis of a stadium smack in the middle of Queens.”</p><p>Forest Hills Stadium supports local community-driven initiatives to give back to Queens, including QueensWay and Queens Community House. Forest Hills Stadium is also preparing to replant the venue’s community garden for the upcoming season. In addition, in an ongoing partnership with Small Axe Peppers, the stadium grows peppers backstage to support the Small Axe mission and use them as garnish and hot sauce at concessions.</p><p>Forest Hills Stadium aims to reduce environmental impact through meaningful actions throughout the venue and behind the scenes. As of last season, Forest Hills Stadium is climate-positive and carbon negative, meaning the venue offsets more than what’s created. In partnership with Anheuser-Busch, the venue will expand and track recycling efforts from concession areas, backstage and beyond all season long.</p><p>Forest Hills Stadium proudly welcomes American Express, Bud Light Seltzer, Autograph, City Winery and WFUV-FM as 2023 Season Partners. AXS is the official ticketing partner for Forest Hills. More shows are to be announced soon; see full calendar below.</p><p><strong><span>2023 SEASON CALENDAR:</span></strong><br>Saturday, May 20th & Sunday, May 21st – Head In The Clouds Music & Arts Festival<br><strong>Saturday, June 3rd – Lane 8, Sultan + Shepard, Jerro, Massane (LIVE), Ocula</strong><br>Sunday, June 4th – Kevin Hart<br><strong>Friday, June 9th – Dave Matthews Band</strong><br>Wednesday, June 14th – BERT KREISCHER’S FULLY LOADED COMEDY FESTIVAL: Shane Gillis, Tiffany Haddish, Dave Attell, Big Jay Oakerson, Dan Soder, Rosebud Baker<br><strong>Friday, June 16th – Re:SET (LCD Soundsystem, Jamie xx, IDLES, L’RAIN & More)</strong><br>Saturday, June 17th – Re:SET (boygenius, Clairo, Dijon, Bartees Strange)<br><strong>Sunday, June 18th – Re:SET (Steve Lacy, James Blake, Toro y Moi, Fousheé)</strong><br>Friday, June 23rd & Saturday, June 24th – Zach Bryan, Charles Wesley Godwin<br><strong>Friday, July 7th – The Smile, Robert Stillman</strong><br>Saturday, July 8th – Two Friends, Matoma, NOTD, Deerock<br><strong>Thursday, July 13th – Weezer, Future Islands, Joyce Manor</strong><br>Thursday, July 27th – Maggie Rogers, Soccer Mommy<br><strong>Saturday, July 29th – Louis Tomlinson</strong><br>Tuesday, August 1st – Fall Out Boy, Bring Me The Horizon, Royal & The Serpent, Games We Play<br><strong>Saturday, August 5th – Rock The Bells Festival</strong><br>Saturday, August 12th – Queens of the Stone Age, Phantogram<br><strong>Thursday, August 17th – Jason Mraz & His Superband w/ The New York Pops</strong><br>Saturday, August 19th – The Strokes, Angel Olsen, Seaton Smith, Promiseland<br><strong>Friday, September 8th & Saturday, September 9th – Arctic Monkeys, Fontaines D.C.</strong><br>Friday, September 15th – Cigarettes After Sex<br><strong>Sunday, September 17th – Willie Nelson’s Outlaw Festival</strong><br>Friday, September 22nd – Duran Duran, Grace Jones, Nile Rodgers & CHIC, Bastille<br><strong>Friday, September 29th – Sylvan Esso, Goth Babe, Charlotte Adigéry & Bolis Pupul</strong><br>Saturday, September 30th – Jungle</p><span itemscope itemtype=http://schema.org/Article class=itempropwp-wrap><span itemprop=image itemscope itemtype=https://schema.org/ImageObject></span></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo77IrbCam5OawLR6wqikaGpgZ4BwfJNoaGtnlqS%2Fpr%2FTZp%2BipJyoerTAwJ2grqVdlruvu9Snmp6rXWZ9cXnYnpirZZGju6rCxKuqmqqpYsCmrdKopWavmam1bsDHnmSsrKKkuKa%2FjLOYnKBdl7%2B6rc1mm5qulWK6osDToZywq12Xrq%2BwjKamq51f</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 DashJ - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
