This week, Kim Kardashian and Kanye West's eldest daughter treated her TikTok followers to a tour of her closet, and zoomed in on several shelves filled with her collection of four-figure (er, five-figure) handbags.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"These are my bags," North captioned the now-deleted post, according to <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Page Six</a>.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_7-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Among the assortment were mini Fendi and Louis Vuitton bags, a Christian Dior saddlebag, and number of sparkly Judith Leiber purses â€” including a pepperoni pizza clutch ($5,965), a Cinderella carriage ($5,965), and one shaped like a strawberry donut ($4,195).

Forget that, she's his twin," she <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>said</a>. "So she will still definitely do all of the above. But in my household, there are rules. She did feel really bad about that, and she apologized to me and she said 'I saw on TikTok that I got in trouble and I'm really sorry.'
