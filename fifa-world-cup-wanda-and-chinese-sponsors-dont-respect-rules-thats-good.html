And as the tournament edges towards its finale on Sunday, Fifa’s chief commercial officer Philippe Le Floc’h has confessed the involvement of the country’s corporate giants has caused a shake-up within the game’s governing body.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Seven companies – Fifa partner Wanda Group, World Cup sponsors Hisense, Mengniu and Vivo as well as regional backers Diking, Yaeda and Luci – have ensured the tournament has had a Chinese presence that has outstripped even the 2002 event, when the national team secured their only successful qualification.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">And their high-profile showing and unique approach to business has forced Fifa to adapt its own practices to accommodate some of the nation’s biggest entities.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“What is interesting with the Chinese companies – because they are new into this world – is they come with new ideas, which is interesting,” Le Floc’h told the South China Morning Post.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“They are fast moving, they are challenging, they don’t take no for an answer. But it’s been a very good exchange.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“Some were a bit late on board but they’ve done an amazing job. So it’s good to have new approaches and a new way of thinking that can transpire into the other conversations that we have.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“They come in and are less respectful of the rules because they’re not used to the rules.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“There’s nothing wrong with that, but they will challenge and come up with new ideas because they really want to engage with people.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“So they have less of an institutional approach, which is always interesting.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The desire of so many Chinese corporate entities to support the World Cup finals came at an opportune moment for Fifa in the aftermath of a series of bribery and corruption scandals that saw the organisation making headlines for all the wrong reasons.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Wanda, Vivo and Hisense signed up after Sony, Castrol and Continental ended their relationships with Fifa and their presence has added to the sense Russia 2018 has been a coming-of-age party for Chinese involvement in the global sport.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">These finals have had a distinct Chinese feel which has extended beyond the corporate side of the event, with more than 40,000 match tickets sold to fans ahead of the finals with significant numbers of mainland media also covering the event.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“It’s not a China push [from Fifa], it’s a world push,” Le Floc’h said of China’s growing visibility at the World Cup. “Football is the world’s sportand Fifahas a global footprint and a global obligation with 211 associations.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/images/methode/2018/07/11/2ec2f9d0-84b2-11e8-99b0-7de4d17a9c3a_972x_115118.JPG><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“The situation we had was a bit of an anomaly where most of our partners were coming from the western world for various reasons.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“Now the world economy is shifting, we see a lot of so-called emerging countries having very aggressive and good companies and these companies have gone beyond the boundaries of the domestic market and they want to go beyond that.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“Our raison d’etre is to develop football on a worldwide basis. In addition, there’s a lot of hype around football in China and we want to help Chinese football to develop, so it’s a good fit.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The new Fifa regime in Zurich under president Gianni Infantino has been looking to take a fresh approach on all fronts, according to Le Floc’h, after 16 officials were indicted by the FBI in 2015.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn2.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/images/methode/2018/07/11/376b422c-84b2-11e8-99b0-7de4d17a9c3a_972x_115118.JPG><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“It’s a very post-colonial approach to ask why we don’t go with western companies,” he said. “We’re a global organisation. We have a clear strategic direction and we want to go and talk to people who can support us.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“We don’t really care about the passport of our partners. We just want to find the right people to support us.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“What has happened in the past with Fifa – like you had with the scandals at the IOC, IAAF – you have a new president, and new management team and we basically have a very clear stance on how we want to proceed and what to do.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“Nobody has ever told me: ‘We don’t want to work with you because of what happened’. What happened, happened and we’ve spoken to people and we explain the measures the new administration has taken to ensure this never happens again and then we are having a conversation.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“The more the merrier and the better mix because being the worldwide sport and having a worldwide footprint our partners should represent the diversity business wise that we have sports wise.”</p><p>This article appeared in the South China Morning Post print edition as: Chinese partners shake up sponsorship game</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tK%2FMqWWcp51kwLG70a1mrKeTmLKze8Crq6KbnJp8c32UbW5tbV%2BbtqetjLCmq6SUYrC2vIywmKeckWKur7CMnJ%2BippWosm6%2Fz6ilrKeiqHqlu82tZKudo6WypMCMq6ylnaNiwamt06xkoKefmQ%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 DashJ - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
