Either way, there’s a reason why durian is dubbed “the king of fruits”.</span></p><p type=p><span type=text>Last month, </span><span type=text>Young Post</span><span type=text> attended a “durian party”&nbsp;</span><span type=span><span type=text>organised by local restaurant Durian BB, which hosts monthly, all-you-can-eat durian buffets in Kwun Tong. There we spoke to Paul Mak, the secretary general of the Malaysian Durian Export Association and Malaysian partner of Durian BB, about the origins of the pungent fruit, what makes Malaysian durians stand out, and how to choose the perfect fruit.</span></span></p><p type=p><span type=text>Originally, there were no durian plantations in Malaysia; instead, durians grew wild, and were collected by the local villagers. Wild durian trees can grow as tall as 30 metres – making it impossible to grow or harvest the fruit on a large scale.</span></p><p class="BodyParagraph__StyledBlockElement-sc-4sxwoh-0 hVXIcN Body__StyledBodyParagraph-sc-1cgoct-1 UAQBx" type=p><span type=text>“The fruit from wild durian trees is very [inconsistent] – it can be either very sweet or tasteless, have very thin or thick flesh. That’s why many years ago the Malaysian farmers started bud grafting durians, where they take one tree sapling and attach it to another,” says Mak.</span></p><p class="BodyParagraph__StyledBlockElement-sc-4sxwoh-0 hVXIcN Body__StyledBodyParagraph-sc-1cgoct-1 UAQBx" type=p><br class="Body__StyleBr-sc-1cgoct-9 ibAFpb"><span type=text></span><span type=span><span type=text>Mak says it takes more than eight years for a sapling to start fruiting, but even then the taste is not ideal. </span></span><span type=span><span type=text>“We do bud-grafting when the saplings are about four years old, and it takes another four to five years for them to mature,” he says. “But they are still considered young trees, and the fruit they produce won’t be as flavourful as that of trees that are 25 years old.”</span></span><br class="Body__StyleBr-sc-1cgoct-9 ibAFpb"><span type=text></span><br class="Body__StyleBr-sc-1cgoct-9 ibAFpb"><span type=text></span><span type=span><span type=text>While durians are also grown in&nbsp;other tropical countries such as Thailand, Vietnam, and the Philippines, what sets Malaysia durians apart, Mak says, is the ripening process. “The most special mark of Malaysian durians is we don’t pluck them from trees; instead, we pick them from the ground. They are 100 per cent naturally ripened on trees, and must be consumed within two to three days from when they fall to the ground,” says Mak.</span></span></p><p class="BodyParagraph__StyledBlockElement-sc-4sxwoh-0 hVXIcN Body__StyledBodyParagraph-sc-1cgoct-1 UAQBx" type=p><strong type=strong><a href=# class="BodyLink__StyledLink-sc-1uefa8x-0 cJwLWs"><span type=text>The best ice cream in Hong Kong: Emack & Bolio’s, Via Tokyo and more</span></a></strong></p><p class="BodyParagraph__StyledBlockElement-sc-4sxwoh-0 hVXIcN Body__StyledBodyParagraph-sc-1cgoct-1 UAQBx" type=p><span type=text>So how does one choose the&nbsp; perfect durian, we asked. “First, you have to smell it. Ripe durians produce a sulphurous smell. Another thing you can do is shake it,&nbsp;so you can hear whether the pulp is stuck to the husk. If there’s movement, then you know the pulp is ripe and&nbsp; dry,” he explains.</span><br class="Body__StyleBr-sc-1cgoct-9 ibAFpb"><span type=text></span><br class="Body__StyleBr-sc-1cgoct-9 ibAFpb"><span type=text>At least 200 varieties of durians&nbsp;have been registered at Malaysia’s agriculture department. Among them, Musang King is the most expensive&nbsp;and sought after variety, and in Hong Kong can cost a few hundred dollars each, sometimes more than a&nbsp;thousand dollars.</span></p><p class="BodyParagraph__StyledBlockElement-sc-4sxwoh-0 hVXIcN Body__StyledBodyParagraph-sc-1cgoct-1 UAQBx" type=p><span type=span><span type=text>“The fruit was named ‘king’ for a reason – many adore the Musang King for its golden-yellow [flesh],” says Mak. “The flesh has a sheen when you first crack open&nbsp;the husk. “It’s sweet, with a bittersweet aftertaste; it’s very creamy, but at the same time fibrous – it’s like eating custard with fibre in it.”</span></span></p><p class="BodyParagraph__StyledBlockElement-sc-4sxwoh-0 hVXIcN Body__StyledBodyParagraph-sc-1cgoct-1 UAQBx" type=p><a href=# class="BodyLink__StyledLink-sc-1uefa8x-0 cJwLWs"><strong type=strong><span type=text>The 5 most creative dim sum dishes in Hong Kong</span></strong></a></p><p class="BodyParagraph__StyledBlockElement-sc-4sxwoh-0 hVXIcN Body__StyledBodyParagraph-sc-1cgoct-1 UAQBx" type=p><span type=span><span type=text>Durians also contain an abundance of vitamins and minerals.&nbsp;“There’s a lot of iron, calcium, potassium, sodium, zinc, vitamin C and vitamin A, but no cholesterol or saturated fats,” he says.</span></span></p><p class="BodyParagraph__StyledBlockElement-sc-4sxwoh-0 hVXIcN Body__StyledBodyParagraph-sc-1cgoct-1 UAQBx" type=p><span type=text>However, even with all the health benefits and nutrients, it should still be consumed in moderation – especially by those who have diabetes – as the pulp is very and high in calories and sugar.</span><br class="Body__StyleBr-sc-1cgoct-9 ibAFpb"><span type=text></span><br class="Body__StyleBr-sc-1cgoct-9 ibAFpb"><span type=text></span><span type=span><span type=text>“A lot of people think durians are very ‘heaty’ ... [this effect is] caused by the sugar, which [boosts your energy] and makes you very active.” he says. “To balance it out, we normally drink a lot of water. The traditional method is drinking lightly salted water from the durian husk.”</span></span></p><p><h4 type=h4><span type=span><span type=text>Edited by Nicole Moraleda</span></span></h4></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tK%2FMqWWcp51kxrF7w6KqnKemmr9wuMifnKysqaGycLLOqJtomaKptqS4xGhqaW1nZYN5e8eormabmKS8tLGMqZyrnpWYwW6w1KugmqZdlrulec6tn56qXZuupMDSZpibp6WperHBzaCcp6w%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 DashJ - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
