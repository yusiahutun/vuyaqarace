Caught up in the chaos which also saw Zhou hit the AlphaTauri of Daniel Ricciardo, incurring a five-second penalty in the process, Bottas dropped from seventh to 12th and never recovered.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Alfa said there had been an issue with the Chinese driver’s “brake system strategy which caused a fail-safe on the engine side and severely compromised the start of his race”.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">For Zhou, that meant the “elation from [Saturday’s qualifying] result turned on its head”.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2023/07/24/ca076a2f-7346-4ee7-9cc3-dac3e1785796_dad7509d.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“We are yet to gather all the information about what exactly went on at the start,” he said. “I was on full throttle, and then all of a sudden, something went wrong and I had to do the entire procedure again just in order to do a proper start.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The mechanical issues left Zhou at the back of the grid. Despite a strategy change and aggressive tactics, the cars did not have the pace to get back into the top 10 of a race won by Red Bull’s Max Verstappen.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Still, Zhou preferred to look on the bright side and said the upgrades the team brought in at Silverstone two weeks ago were moving Alfa in the right direction.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Alessandro Bravi, the Alfa team representative, said much the same, adding that the focus would move on to ensuring the issues that dogged the team in Hungary were resolved before the Belgian Grand Prix this Sunday.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“[This] result is upsetting for the team, but there is at least one major positive from the weekend: our overall performance improved from the previous races,” Bravi said. “We must carry it with us as we head to Spa next week, for the final race before the summer break.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2023/07/24/452cc94d-f602-4f43-8524-7ae81de5edad_291fe66e.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Verstappen meanwhile will carry his dominant form into the race at Spa-Francorchamps, with little sign that his misstep in qualifying at the Hungaroring was anything other than a minor bump in the road to another world championship.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The Dutchman racked up a record-breaking 12th consecutive win for Red Bull and extended his lead at the top of the drivers’ championship to 110 points.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">After blowing past pole-sitter Lewis Hamilton on the opening lap, Verstappen raced off into the distance to claim his seventh successive victory of a truly lop-sided F1 season.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Hamilton finished only fourth after both McLaren drivers also moved ahead of him inside the first two bends of Sunday’s 70-lap race.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Lando Norris was runner-up to Verstappen for the second consecutive race, 33.7 seconds behind the dominant Dutchman, while Red Bull’s Sergio Perez fought back from ninth to third with Oscar Piastri crossing the line in fifth.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“Hopefully we can keep this momentum going for a long time,” said Verstappen, whose win on Sunday was his 24th since the start of last season.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“I think it was a pretty perfect day. Of course, it’s really enjoyable to work with the whole team and to have this kind of success.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“I think people probably forget how tough it is to win 12 in a row. Even when you have the fastest car. It’s easy to make mistakes, or have an off weekend.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tK%2FMqWWcp51kwLG70a1mn6eiosKtrYyopZ5llmZ8or7TopqlnV9of3OElm1raJ6fp7q2uMBmpqedXa%2B1sMGMoKyapqmqwG66yKCfraWRp7Juv9Oaqa1lmKq7qK3RopinZZenrq%2BwjKmporBdmK62v8SdZJuqkaCybrXSrKyeZZGhs6J50aiknqddqK66</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 DashJ - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
