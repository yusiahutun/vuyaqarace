"But this time, someone else said something to the effect of 'Is this guy really going to watch this right in front of us?' and I recall saying, 'I got this.' And I picked up the cane and went to work on him."</p><p>Watson then went to find a prison guard to report what had happened , when he said he encountered another sex offender.</p><p>"As I got to the lower tier, I saw a known child trafficker, and I figured I'd just do everybody a favor," he wrote. "In for a penny, in for a pound."</p><p>He said he then beat the second inmate to death with the cane.</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:513a8e24-869c-55ae-b672-cb41f7a32eb7 data-container-ref=toofab:article:2bb15618-945e-5cdd-a3c1-c9d22d9571f5 data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=27><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/4d/5by4/2020/02/20/4d205fe8e2065d84b87e6a3602489d7e_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">Montgomery County Jail</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">Watch Prisoner End Up In Trash Can After Spectacular Escape Fail</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><p>When he finally reached the prison officer, he told him "I've got some pretty bad news for you," to which the guard, according to Watson, jokingly replied: "You're not going to hit me with that cane are you?"</p><p>"So after jesting for a moment, knowing this might be the last decent moment that I have for a long time, I told him what I'd just done, which he also didn't believe until he looked around the corner and saw the mess I'd left in the dorm area."</p><p>The two killed inmates are never named in Watson's letter. But in a news release last month, the prison identified Watson as responsible for the killing of two prisoners: 48-year-old David Bobb, and 62-year-old Graham De Luis-Conti — both of whom were serving life sentences for convictions of aggravated sexual assault involving children under the age of 14.</p><p>No new charges have yet been filed against Watson, who himself is serving life for a 2009 murder conviction. In his letter he says he will plead guilty to both murders, and said he would do it again if housed with any more child molesters in the future.</p><p>"Being a lifer, I'm in a unique position where I sometimes have access to these people and I have so little to lose," he wrote.</p><p>"And trust me, we get it, these people are every parents' worst nightmare. These familys (sic) spend years carefully and articulately planning how to give their children every opportunity that they never had, and one monster comes along and changes that child's trajectory forever."</p><p>The California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation declined to comment to the publication on the letter, citing an ongoing investigation.</p><p><strong>Got a story or a tip for us?
