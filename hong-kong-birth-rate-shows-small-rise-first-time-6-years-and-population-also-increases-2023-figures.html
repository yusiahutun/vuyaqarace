This term covers permanent residents who have stayed in Hong Kong for at least three of the six months before the census or for at least three of the six months afterwards, irrespective of whether they were in the city during the count. There was a 0.1 per cent increase in the number of usual residents last year.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The term also includes non-permanent residents who are in Hong Kong at the reference time point.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">There was also an increase of 10.2 per cent in the “mobile residents” category – permanent residents who have stayed in the city for at least one month, but less than three months, during the six months before or after the reference time point, regardless of their location at that time.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The category can include people who spend most of the week on the mainland, but who stay in Hong Kong on a regular basis at weekends, students who study abroad but return on holidays, and people who live overseas but are frequent visitors to the city for business, work or family reasons.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Last October, city leader John Lee Ka-chiu announced couples would be given a HK$20,000 cash handout for each newborn in a bid to tackle Hong Kong’s low birth rate and encourage childbearing. The scheme, set to initially run for three years and cost HK$2.2 billion, was approved by the Legislative Council last month.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The government expects the number of annual births to rise by a fifth to about 39,000.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-TitleText class="css-66qo9a eeeqn932">Population experts shrug off Hong Kong losing top spot in life expectancy</span></p></a></h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">But Felix Yan Ho-on, chairman of the Hong Kong Early Childhood Educators Association, said the increase of births last year was not enough to sustain the preschool sector.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“There are around 1,000 kindergartens in Hong Kong, and 700 more babies [born last year] means one kindergarten will not even get one more student on average,” he said. “And there is also uncertainty over whether these babies will stay in Hong Kong and enter local schools after three years.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">He said the government’s cash incentive would be a “bonus” but not a trigger for couples to have babies.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“People would not give birth because of this bonus, as it was said you need several million dollars to raise a kid,” he said.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Professor Paul Yip Siu-fai, the chair professor of population health at the department of social work and social administration at the University of Hong Kong, noted the number of marriages had been rising since the pandemic ended but they were not being matched by a similar increase in births.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-TitleText class="css-66qo9a eeeqn932">3-year decline in number of Hongkongers applying for UK universities</span></p></a></h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The number of marriages increased by 11 per cent and by nearly 60 per cent in 2022 and 2023 respectively when compared with the previous year.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“This is the reason I am not that pessimistic about the future birth number,” Yip said, but added that the government’s goal to reach an annual target of 39,000 new births was “comparatively optimistic”.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Hundreds of thousands of Hongkongers have also emigrated overseas since January 2021 after the British government rolled out a bespoke pathway to citizenship in the wake of Beijing’s imposition of a national security law in 2020.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">According to data from the country’s Home Office, about 184,700 Hongkongers have successfully applied for British National (Overseas) visas to settle in the country since the scheme’s launch in 2021.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The visas allow them to live, study and work in Britain, as well as apply for permanent residency after living in the United Kingdom for five years, followed by citizenship a year after.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Several Western countries, including Canada and Australia, have also offered “lifeboat” settlement schemes to Hongkongers.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tK%2FMqWWcp51ku6bD0mifqKaXYriwusZoqqibmZrBunvAq6uim5yafHR%2BlGtscnFfnbyvs4ykpqefXZe2s8DHZqmarJViwKm71qxkrKWRobluvsisnGaemafAtXnToqSeZWZixqat0axkmqaUYr2wvNSlmK2hn6N6orjSqGSippOnsqK%2FxKxka2hiaHqntcauqZ6r</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy;
