The deal was, if you win on The Rap Game, you get a single from Jermaine Dupri. So that single came out.”</p><p>He continued: “The problem was, was that Latto was 16 years old, and the outlets didn’t support it. And nobody was like speaking on it. Nobody talked about it. If you watched the TV show, you saw it.
