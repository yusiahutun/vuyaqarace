However, an expert slammed them for pretending to be Diana 2.0, stating how their Sussex brand has nothing in common with Princess Diana’s after leaving the royal family.</strong></p><p><a href=#>Meghan Markle</a> and <a href=#>Prince Harry</a> had a turbulent 2023. With their $20 million Spotify deal being canceled, to breakup rumors spreading like wildfire, the two have faced a lot this year. The future of many of their projects seems uncertain at the moment. In the midst of all this, a royal expert has slammed them for acting like Diana 2.0, claiming it’s not working for them.</p><figure class="wp-block-grvmedia-grv-video GRVMultiVideo"></figure><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.celebritytidbit.com/uploads/39/2023/12/GettyImages-1683497427-1-1024x753.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-prince-harry-and-meghan-acting-like-princess-diana-2-0>Prince Harry and Meghan ‘acting like Princess Diana 2.0’</h2><p>While speaking to GB News, journalist Kinsey Schofield <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">opined</a> that Meghan and Harry are continuing to play saints. She then marked the stark contrast between the Sussexes’ brand and the late <a href=#>Princess Diana</a>‘s brand post leaving the royals.</p><p>Schofield notes how Diana did extensive charity work even after leaving the royal family. The late Princess of Wales’ public service was well-documented, the journalist points out. She also highlights how Diana was pictured touching aids patients, holding malnourished babies, caressing cancer patients, and more.</p><p>However, Schofield notes that “When you think of Harry and Meghan, you visualize them sitting next to Oprah Winfrey.” She also says that one thinks of them “constantly complaining” and of their “glossy Netflix billboards.”</p><p>According to the royal commentator, Diana Meghan and Harry’s brands are not comparable, despite them constantly telling us they are Princess Diana 2.0. The journalists point out that Harry and Meghan seem to be very vindictive in their work since leaving the royal family.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.celebritytidbit.com/uploads/39/2023/12/GettyImages-52103260-1024x684.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-meghan-returns-to-acting-with-coffee-ad>Meghan returns to acting with coffee ad</h2><p>Although Meghan gave up her acting career when she joined the royal family in 2018, rumor has it that she’s now planning to return to her previous job.</p><p>The Duchess of Sussex (sort of) made a return to acting in a coffee brand’s promotional video. She made a few not-so-sneaky appearances in the latest Clevr Blends <a href=#>Instagram</a> video. Meghan is also an investor in the coffee brand.</p><p>The promotional clip sees the brand’s co-founder, Hannah Mendoza, taking customers to the Clevr Blends headquarters and showing their team. We see the former Suits actress making multiple appearances throughout the video.</p><p>At first, she’s seen packing coffee boxes. Then she is seen working on a computer and, finally, she hands Mendoza a drink from the fridge.</p><p>In the final clip, we see Meghan walk right in front of the camera as she tries to give a failed fist bump to a Clevr Blends employee. The two of them break into laughter after the failure.</p><p>Related Topics</p><p>MORE CELEBRITY STORIES</p><span></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuwaqwwaKrZ5ufonxzfJFsZmpqX2eGcLzRoqWcnV2drrO%2B2GaYp5xdorKotMCnZJqbpJ67qHnLoqKeZaCntq%2BvxKyqZpyZlruieZFmZ2aapal6qsDSZqWorF2svLO3yKeeaA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 DashJ - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
