But with new producers at the helm, more sketchy ideas are being explored, with an intimacy coordinator being taken on to ease actors into more raunchy scenes.</p><p>But despite the changes to the show, which show characters' more intimate moments, it seems the stars of the soap know all about being raunchy. Several of the show's stars have come out to confess what they get up to in bed.</p><p><b>READ MORE: <a data-content-type=news data-link-tracking=InArticle|Link href=#>Neighbours 2024 predictions – Haz bombshell, heartbreaking death and bad boy returns</a></b></p><p><b>READ MORE:</b> <a data-content-type=news data-link-tracking=InArticle|Link href=#><b>Join the Daily Star Soaps WhatsApp for all the latest spoilers and exclusives</b></a></p><p>So, as the residents of Erinsborough continue to get up to no good, Daily Star looks at some of the stars of Neighbours' admissions about their bedroom antics.</p><h3>Porn star directors</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i2-prod.dailystar.co.uk/incoming/article31842332.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/2_JS228860499.jpg><h5 class="publication-theme-icon publication-theme-border">Read More</h5><h5 class="hidden related-articles publication-theme-icon publication-font">Related Articles</h5><ul><li data-tmdatatrack=read-more data-tmdatatrack-articleid=31696787><a class="embed-image hidden" href=# data-link-tracking=InArticle|Rec|ReadMore|index1|Image aria-label="Neighbours' Krista star almost played two completely different roles in Aussie soap" data-tmdatatrack=read-more data-tmdatatrack-articleid=31696787><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i2-prod.dailystar.co.uk/incoming/article31696081.ece/ALTERNATES/s458/0_MAIN_KRISTA.jpg></a> <a href=# data-image=https://i2-prod.dailystar.co.uk/incoming/article31696081.ece/ALTERNATES/s615/0_MAIN_KRISTA.jpg data-link-tracking=InArticle|Rec|ReadMore|index1|text data-tmdatatrack=read-more data-tmdatatrack-articleid=31696787>Neighbours' Krista star almost played two completely different roles in Aussie soap</a><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/s2-prod.mirror.co.uk/@trinitymirrordigital/chameleon-branding/publications/dailystar/img/logo-schema-dailystar.png alt=dailystar style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></li></ul><h5 class="publication-theme-icon publication-theme-border">Read More</h5><h5 class="hidden related-articles publication-theme-icon publication-font">Related Articles</h5><ul><li data-tmdatatrack=read-more data-tmdatatrack-articleid=29480890><a class="embed-image hidden" href=# data-link-tracking=InArticle|Rec|ReadMore|index2|Image aria-label="Neighbours: The Celebration Tour review as stars send triumphant 'thank you' to fans" data-tmdatatrack=read-more data-tmdatatrack-articleid=29480890><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/s2-prod.mirror.co.uk/@trinitymirrordigital/chameleon-branding/publications/dailystar/img/logo-schema-dailystar.png></a> <a href=# data-image=https://i2-prod.dailystar.co.uk/showbiz/article29480885.ece/ALTERNATES/s615/1_Full-Cast-Please-credit-Tremaine-Gregg-when-using-1.jpg data-link-tracking=InArticle|Rec|ReadMore|index2|text data-tmdatatrack=read-more data-tmdatatrack-articleid=29480890>Neighbours: The Celebration Tour review as stars send triumphant 'thank you' to fans</a><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/s2-prod.mirror.co.uk/@trinitymirrordigital/chameleon-branding/publications/dailystar/img/logo-schema-dailystar.png alt=dailystar style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></li></ul><p>Caitlin Stasey had been a staple of Ramsay Street when she first joined the soap in 2005. Playing the role of Rachel Kinski on the show, her character was described as "an introverted girl who has had a sheltered life, but she's a really sweet girl".</p><p>However, after leaving the show in 2009, things took a more raunchy turn for actress Caitlin. In 2021, 12 years after she left Erinsborough behind, she announced that she would be entering the world of adult films.</p><p>The 33-year-old has now left her TV career in the past as she takes on the role of a director and writer in a female-owned pornography studio, Afterglow. The studio was described by Caitlin herself as being "very inclusive", and has had a number of films published with Stasey behind the wheel, including U Up? and Eau de P***y.</p><p>Working as a writer, Caitlin explained how the concept for the films come about, specifically with Eau de P***y. She joked that the plots for porn feel like they have been done through artificial intelligence, but leaning into intimacy works.</p><p>"They're always so sexy and it always feels like sex is about to happen - everyone's sniffing each other's necks and licking each other's wrists," she said. "So I kind of came up with the concept of a perfume commercial that then becomes a lesbian threesome."</p><h3>Sensual self-love</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i2-prod.dailystar.co.uk/showbiz/article29480885.ece/ALTERNATES/s458/1_Full-Cast-Please-credit-Tremaine-Gregg-when-using-1.jpg><p>Following her split from MasterChef Australia judge Shannon Bennett in 2018, Madeleine West, who played Andrea Somers on the soap, spilt the beans on their sex life. She admitted that after 13 years of married life, she was terrified to be intimate with another man after she had taken on racy roles in other shows including Satisfaction and Underbelly.</p><p>"I know I'm an attractive woman and I’ve done a gazillion sex scenes for work and I started to envision how to perform like a woman half my age," she explained to Mia Freedman on her No Filter podcast. However, she made an important realisation when she was moving on from her previous relationship.</p><p>"I am my sexiest when I am just being me," she insisted. "I’ve birthed six children, I look after my body, I’ve worked hard in life and ever since that realisation, I’ve enjoyed [sex] ever since."</p><p>West added that she was attracted to her current partner Maximo Bottaro after a chance meeting. When asked about what she likes about her partner, she explained: "His self-belief was possibly the most attractive thing."</p><h3>Breakdown in trust</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/s2-prod.mirror.co.uk/@trinitymirrordigital/chameleon-branding/publications/dailystar/img/logo-schema-dailystar.png><p>However, not every confession has been raunchy, as former Neighbours hunk Craig McLachlan revealed he had developed social anxiety after being accused of sexual assault. Craig, 58, was a former heartthrob on the soap when he played Henry Ramsay on the soap from 1987 to 1989.</p><p>However, things began to fall apart for Craig when allegations he had assaulted four women on the set of the Aussie production of The Rocky Horror Show. He was eventually charged of the incident, but won an appeal, earning £250,000 in damages.</p><p>Opening up to hard man Ant Middleton on the Australian version of SAS: Who Dares Wins, McLachlan admitted he was in random people's lounges "night after night, day after day". But following the allegations, people took a more cautious approach to the actor which he found "shocking".</p><p>As a result of the issues, Craig said he found it hard to form a bond. "I find it very difficult to trust situations where there are a lot of people, especially women," he admitted.</p><p><i>Neighbours is available to stream on Amazon Freevee.</i></p><p><i><b>For more of the latest showbiz and TV news from the Daily Star, make sure you sign up for one of our newsletters <a data-content-type=section data-link-tracking=InArticle|Link href=# rel=follow>here</a>.</b></i></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pa3IpbCsrJGne6S7ja6iaKymZLumtcahmaitoqh6pK3SrWSsnahisLC6xZ6qrKGfo8BueZJqb21qYmeD</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 DashJ - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
