The news comes just two months after Chiapponi’s departure from Tod’s, where he helmed both the men’s and women’s collections and was tasked with bringing a more contemporary but still elegant edge to the classically minded luxury fashion house. There’s no doubt the mindset was similar in the hiring process for Blumarine, which has seen a comeback of sorts over the last few seasons, with nostalgic 1990s and Y2K-era collections that hearken back to some of the more recognizable house codes, with a youthful twist—to wit: baby cardigans with fur collars, rhinestone-bedecked tanks, and denim miniskirts.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=1 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Chiapponi, who has worked previously for brands like Bottega Veneta, Miu Miu, and Gucci, will present his first collection for Blumarine during the Fall 2024 season in Milan. Marco Marchi, director of Eccellenze Italiane, the holding company that owns Blumarine, said in a statement that he is “confident that Walter Chiapponi, with this internationally recognized talent and his fine stylistic sensibility, will bring new energy to Blumarine while honoring the brand’s extraordinary heritage.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=2 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Chiapponi, too, said he is motivated by the possibilities of evolving the storied, playful brand. In his own statement, he explained that he is “delighted to have been appointed creative director of an iconic Italian brand that has outlined over time an idea of felinity that is defined by lightness and creativity.” He went on to say that “the possibility of contributing to establishing a new phase for Blumarine is for me an opportunity to embrace new thrilling and important horizons, to expand my vision and to restore sense to artistic expression.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=4 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">As he has also worked with Alessandro Dell’Acqua and Valentino, it will be interesting to see how Chiapponi’s deep experience across brands with varying points of views on sartorial sophistication will come into play in this new position. By February, we might have a slightly more grown-up version of Blumarine.</p><span class="css-1s9owpq ev8dhu51"><img data-dynamic-svg=true src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.harpersbazaar.com/_assets/design-tokens/harpersbazaar/static/images/logos/lettermark.934d28d.svg?primary=%2523000" data-testid=dynamic-svg-base height=100 width=100 alt=Lettermark style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></span><p>Brooke Bobb is the fashion news director at Harper’s Bazaar, working across print and digital platforms.
