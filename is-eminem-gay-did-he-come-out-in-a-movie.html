Why do fans think he is gay, even with his supposed utterances regarding the community? Keep reading to find out.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Who_Is_Eminem></span>Who Is Eminem?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Marshall Bruce Mathers III, known by his stage name Eminem, is an American rapper, songwriter, and record producer. He was born in St. Joseph, Missouri, on October 17, 1972. He has Scottish, Welsh, English, Cherokee, German, Swiss, Polish, and possibly Luxembourgish ancestry.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/gistfest.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/em-young-819x1024.jpg><p>Eminem is the only child of Marshall Bruce Mathers Jr. and Deborah Rae. His parents were in a band called “Daddy Warbucks” but split up when his father abandoned his family. Eminem was just a year and a half old.&nbsp;</p><p>His mother raised him alone but in poverty, as she was a single mother trying to make headway. He was bullied and beaten several times due to his poor background and did not enjoy much of his childhood.&nbsp;</p><p>Young Eminem found solace in music and began to write rap after discovering hip-hop. He attended several open mic contests and took up rapping professionally. Eminem has been in the game for over 30 years with a career that has broken multiple records and won numerous awards.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/gistfest.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Emienm.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Is_Eminem_Gay></span>Is Eminem Gay?&nbsp;<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>In December 2014, Eminem appeared in Sony’s film, “The Interview,” which featured stars like James Franco. In the scripted <a href=#>appearance</a>, Eminem, who played himself in the movie, confessed that he was gay. This shocked everyone in the scene, and Franco told the rapper to repeat what he said as it sounded unbelievable.</p><p>Eminem admitted again that he was gay and said, “I’m more shocked that people haven’t figured it out yet.”</p><p>He added,</p><p>“I’ve been playing gay peek-a-boo for years. I’ve pretty much been leaving a gay breadcrumb trail.”</p>Eminem.<p>When Seth Rogen’s character told Franco to question Eminem about his lyrics from “Medicine Ball,” he said, “I said nice rectum, I had a vasectomy, Hector / So you can’t get pregnant if I bisexually wreck ya.”&nbsp;</p><p>He then reconfirms and says, “Hector’s rectum was real.” This left Franco and the entire production crew shocked again.&nbsp;</p><p>However, the movie producers later revealed that the film was scripted. Although the “Mockingbird” rapper <a href=#>played himself</a> in the movie, he only said his lines, with the other cast members reacting according to the script.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/gistfest.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/em.jpg><p>The script was written to generate buzz for the film, and seeing how viral it went on the internet, it is safe to say that they reached their goal. We can confirm that Eminem is not gay despite the movie appearance and other rumors.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Is_Eminem_Homophobic></span>Is Eminem Homophobic?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Eminem has been accused of being homophobic multiple times due to his frequent use of anti-gay lyrics. In one of his hit singles, “Criminal,” a line mentioned his hatred towards gay people. He raps,</p><p>“Stab you in the head whether you’re a f*gg*t or les, Hate f*gs? The answer’s yes.”&nbsp;</p>Eminem.<p>In a diss track against rapper Tyler The Creator called “Fall,” he says, “Tyler create nothing, I see why you called yourself a faggot, bitch / It’s not just ’cause you lack attention / It’s ’cause you worship D12’s balls, you’re sac-religious.”&nbsp;</p><p>These lyrics were quite offensive to the LGBTQ+ community and the world. The rapper has not addressed the outrage or clarified if he is homophobic or not. Some people say it’s just lyrics and the rapper means no harm, but many say he is homophobic and hates the gay community.&nbsp;</p><p>Contrary to his lyrics, the “Not Afraid” rapper’s actions do not indicate that he is homophobic. He has performed with artists in the LGBTQ+ community, such as the legendary Elton John. He also gifted the singer and his husband, David Furnish, matching diamond penis rings when they tied the knot in 2005.</p><p>In an interview with the New York Times in 2010, Eminem expressed his support for gay marriage and apologized to Tyler the Creator for his offensive slurs against him in his “Fall” single.&nbsp;</p><p>For a long time, the hip-hop community and rappers have been said to be homophobic due to the rawness of the rap artistry. Famous rap artists like <a href=#>Nicki Minaj</a> and Jay Z have also been accused of hating the LGBTQ+ community through their songs.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmifmajBp7HSrWWcp51ktrR5xKagp52dYrSixYydoJ1lmJp6pLvMnmSoraRitq95wGakqK6Zmnw%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 DashJ - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
