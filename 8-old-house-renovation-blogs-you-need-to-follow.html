What I saw made me gasp. I was literally breathless and speechless.<p>When Doug tells the story, this is where he says, "I knew right then it was going to be ours. There was no going back. It didn't matter what was behind, above, or under that stairwell. As soon as she gasped, the rest of it didn't matter. We would fix it.

The author and her husband keep busy filling their 1890 Victorian home with fantastic flea market, auction and Craigslist scores we could only dream of landing.

Ross admits to being "awestruck and mesmerized by the huge structure... [with] a desperate, aching yearning to be a part of its resurrection." He's been chipping way at the project ever since, and chronicles his adventures in the most inspiring way on his blog, Restoring Ross.</p><p class="css-x6js8g et3p2gv0"><strong>Our Favorite Quote:</strong></p>Most disturbing and altogether terrifying, the house needed a ton of work. However, a-ton-of-work can in no way truly convey the reality of just how much work was required. The projected expense and time required to even make the house livable (much less fully restored) was, yes, terrifying. Terrifying on a profound, shocking, alarming, lock-me-away level.<p class="css-x6js8g et3p2gv0">Read more at <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=http://restoringross.com/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Restoring Ross" class="body-link css-a3mbhf et3p2gv0">Restoring Ross</a>.<br></p><h2 class="css-1weljep e1tmud0h7">Chateau de Gudanes Restoration</h2><img alt="Tree, Building, House, Villa, Manor house, Shrub, Mansion, Stately home, Garden, Hill station, " data-cy=slide-image-5 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/clv.h-cdn.co/assets/16/29/640x426/gallery-1469122444-chateau.jpg title="Tree, Building, House, Villa, Manor house, Shrub, Mansion, Stately home, Garden, Hill station, " width=750 height=500 decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-1lk26yx e6iqukd2">Courtesy of Chateau de Gudanes Restoration</span><p class="css-x6js8g et3p2gv0">You might have been cool in high school. You might even still consider yourself to be cool now. But no matter how cool you are, you aren't anywhere near as cool as this Australian family, who bought a larger-than-life chateau in the French Pyrénées that they are currently in the process of restoring.

Three years later, armed with exquisite taste and a knack for seeing the potential under vinyl siding, he found himself the proud owner of an 1865 fixer-upper in Kingston, New York—and you'll get to peek inside if you read his blog, Manhattan Nest.

One look at Rachael Meyerink's perfectly-patterned, finished dining room might change that.

I did not do this with the intention of actually pursuing its purchase. Emailing him listings for old houses is just something I DO. Living in an old house has been a dream for as long as I can remember. I love anything that is old and has a story behind it. If I had drawn a picture of my childhood "dream house," it would have looked like this house. But buy it? No.<br><br><p>Once my husband and I stepped inside the house, it was over.
