It's easy to imagine her walking into an old-fashioned photo call with a plunging cleavage saying 'Hello, boys'.</p><p>Her lover, the crooked Peter Foster, has, of course, always had a preference for beauty queens and topless models.</p><p>Cherie is said to be dependent on Caplin but is now believed to be equally dependent on her hairdresser, Andre Suard. He also has been drawn into the family and tells her that she looks gorgeous, slim and young, so maybe it's reassurance and admiration she craves.</p><p>Otherwise what has Carole done for Mrs Blair except make her look a greedy idiot, dependent on cranky new-age remedies, with an inclination to do unfortunate picture shoots?</p><p>The Prime Minister's wife has an increasing resemblance to Fergie at her worst, with her penchant for rebirthing, lymphatic drainage and obtaining cosmic energy from potions made out of strawberry leaves grown in a neolithic stone circle.</p><p>Cherie has emerged as gullible, suggestible and a bit clingy and pathetic.</p><p>THE sadness is that left to her own devices she could only have done better.</p><p>Certainly when Tony Blair came to power we rather admired her as an austere, uncompromising career woman who hated the limelight.</p><p>Since then she's paid Carole Caplin to reinvent her as a paranoid, insecure freeloader who is traumatised by her body, can't put on her own lipstick and has an entrenched Catholic guilt about sex.</p><p>She's a powerful, pampered, wealthy woman but chose to go on television to tell us that she's often exhausted as she juggles her demanding life.</p><p>Most of us with any sense were irritated to be told it's tough at the top, because it's tougher at the bottom. Thousands of women juggle work, commuting, children, housework and cooking, and still manage to put in their own rollers and buy their own frocks.</p><p>Cherie has recourse to every fashion, beauty and style expert in the world, who would be delighted to visit her at Downing Street. But instead of getting help on a professional, detached basis, she wanted a combination of girlie best friend, tame psychiatrist and sycophant.</p><p>This is why Carole Caplin knows more about the Blairs than any hired hand should know about her employers.</p><p>She must know if the PM feels any guilt about the war and the death of Dr Kelly.</p><p>She's aware of what Cherie truly thinks of Fiona Millar and Alastair Campbell. She knows what the Blairs quarrel about and whether or not Leo's conception was an accident.</p><p>She knows if Leo has had the MMR jab (which, of course, he hasn't).</p><p>She's seen the PM get irritated by the constant presence of his mother-in-law.</p><p>She's been told what really happened when Euan got drunk in Leicester Square. SHE must have experienced the true ghastliness of Cherie's lecherous father and witnessed at close quarters the real Tony Blair, as opposed to the performer.</p><p>She's said to have given him massages when he would have been wiser to employ a masseur.</p><p>She's a highly sexed woman and only she knows the depth of their friendship.</p><p>She has vowed that she will not write a book about her years as part of the Blair family. They have, after all, given her fame, money and status.</p><p>They have been her passport to free holidays, perks and power.</p><p>Tony Blair appears to have finally made up his mind that Carole has to go, but his decision has come about three years too late.</p><p>In this, as in so many areas of his premiership, his judgment has proved to be deeply faulty.</p><p>Certainly without the Caplin factor most of us today would have more respect for Cherie than we do.</p><p>I'VE totally lost the plot of George Best's love life. He's a 57-year-old alcoholic with a liver transplant who is back on the bottle. He still appears to have enough energy to be an insatiable stud, with at least three young blondes fighting over his body. His physician can only be proud of his patient's libido and stamina.</p><p>ON tour in The Graduate,Glynis Barber has refused to do the famous nude scene.</p><p>I'm not in any position to sneer as in my repertory company days I once had to appear in a Lancashire farce in a bikini, over which I insisted on wearing an open dressing gown.</p><p>This wasn't due to modesty but self-consciousness about my buxom thighs. I also wore teeteringly high white pointed stilettoes in which I bore an undeniable resemblance to Dick Emery in drag.</p><p>How J-Lo can you go?</p><p>JENNIFER LOPEZ and Ben Affleck cancelled their Pounds 1.5 million wedding and have finally split. She's devastated and feels humiliated and he looks relieved and thankful.</p><p>Evidently he was urged to walk away by his shrewd mother, Chris.</p><p>She said something on the lines of: 'If you marry her, she'll wear you out.</p><p>Life is too short to end up with a paranoid neurotic who needs nonstop reassurance, praise and attention. Don't do it, son.' MADONNA insists that she wrote her newly published children's book because when she wanted to read to her son Rocco she found that the stories were remote from real life. They were about princes, princesses and happy endings and never about anybody struggling for things.</p><p>Madonna is either telling porkies or she hasn't opened a children's book since she was seven.</p><p>This is because for years authors have been writing about inner-city problems, poor children, neglected children and children with two gay daddies and an absent mummy.</p><p>Escapism it ain't.</p><p>A LAWN UNTO HIMSELF . . .</p><p>When his wife returned she went bananas and it transpired the digger was at the wrong property. 'It's comical really,' says Mr Gravez.</p><p>Most men seeing their beloved garden destroyed would turn nasty.</p><p>Lovely Mr Gravez merely thought it was intended as a treat for him, didn't want to spoil his wife's surprise and even sees the funny side.</p><p>Clearly he's a sweet-natured, glorious optimist with a merry heart, who ended up making the distraught digger driver a cup of tea to calm him down.</p><p>You may currently be surrounded by scorched earth and empty flower beds, Mrs Gravez, but you've got a gem of a husband.</p><p>ROBIN COOK has protested at plans to house students in a flat in the Scottish block where he lives.</p><p>In a letter to Edinburgh council, he writes with staggering pomposity: 'Although I am no longer in government I remain very prominent in public life and it is important for me that my home base is a place of privacy where I am secure from any form of confrontation.' It's important to us all, Mr Cook.</p><p>ONE evening Chris Gravez, of Shanklin on the Isle of Wight, got home to find a man in a bulldozer tearing up his plants and bushes. He didn't stop the driver because he assumed his wife must have contacted a television garden makeover team to give him a wonderful birthday present.</p><p>The race that no one wins</p><p>AFTER the collapse of a Pounds 7 million investigation into his conduct, one of Britain's most senior ethnic minority police officers plans to bring a race discrimination claim against the Metropolitan Police.</p><p>Married Iranian-born Superintendent Ali Dizaei consorted with lap dancers and left a terrifyingly threatening phone message for a girlfriend who dumped him. He had several mistresses and frequently went off to have sex with them during his working hours.</p><p>Clearly racial discrimination was involved. If he'd been white, he'd have been drummed out of the police force years ago.</p><p>SIXTY-year-old Mick Jagger was staggered when beautiful Ukrainian actress Milla Jovovich, 27, refused to go out with him. 'Mick isn't used to women turning him down,' says a friend. The ageing rock star usually inspires instant submission, so rejection is the best way to attract him. When you've been spoiled and indulged for far too long, only the unobtainable is desirable.</p><p>WAY OFF THE RECORD</p><p>MARGARET HODGE is the 59-year-old Minister for Children.</p><p>She's stocky with appalling dress sense, but reveals that she and a group of middle-aged female colleagues call themselves The Volupts, short for voluptuous.</p><p>She, of course, is the woman who has shamingly rewritten history about her failure to help sexually-abused children. When it comes to her record and her physical appeal, Ms Hodge is a stranger to the truth.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pa3IpbCmmZmhe6S7ja6iaJ6Voq6quI6aqa2hk6Gybn6Rcm9vb1%2BMtaLA0mZ6mqqfobJuj8eeqaKdXaKurLGMn6aopF2dsrN6x62kpQ%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 DashJ - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
