What they likely are now wondering about is: Where did she get&nbsp;that gorgeous wedding dress, and can we see a little more of it? While we can glimpse just enough of the singer's gown to tell it's a stunner, we'd sure like to see the whole thing.</p><p>Well, for those who would like to get a closer look at the details of Lambert's gown, it's readily available to see online, and even order for yourself should you be planning a wedding of your own! Popular wedding dress designer Lela Rose confirmed on Instagram that&nbsp;Lambert is wearing their "Canyon" style.</p><p>"What a beautiful bride," the designer enthuses.</p><figure class="img-tag has-sizer alignnone"><p><span class=visually-hidden>Lela Rose</span></p>Lela Rose<p>loading...</p></figure><p>The "Canyon" dress, which can be found on the Lela Rose <a href=#>website</a>&nbsp;and seen on their model above,&nbsp;is entirely made of lace, with demurely long sleeves&nbsp;set off by a daring, plunging neckline. It's elegantly form-fitting,&nbsp;swirling into a bit of swoosh at the bottom, with&nbsp;a slight train (also composed of the same beautiful lace). Overall it is a classic design that will look lovely in photos for years to come, and is perfectly&nbsp;suited to&nbsp;a winter wedding.</p><p>Overall it is a quite different look than the one Lambert chose for her wedding to Blake Shelton in 2011. For that ceremony, she wore her mother's spaghetti-strap wedding gown, a pair of cowboy boots, and carried a "bouquet" created from jeweled brooches.</p><p>Lambert announced over Valentine's Day weekend that she'd secretly tied the knot with New York City police officer&nbsp;Brendan Mcloughlin, whom she termed the "love of my life." The exact&nbsp;date of the wedding has not been confirmed, nor are there many details available.&nbsp;A wedding venue in Henderson, Tenn. called Cogan's Farm shared the news on&nbsp;<a href=#>Facebook</a>,&nbsp;adding that they like her style, so that may be at least one clue to where the happy event took place.</p><p>Lambert divorced Shelton in 2015, and has had an up-and-down love life since then. She dated singer&nbsp;<a href=#>Anderson East</a>&nbsp;through&nbsp;early 2018,&nbsp;and&nbsp;reportedly began dating Turnpike Troubadours singer Evan Felker after. Her relationship with&nbsp;Mcloughlin has, remarkably, been kept private until now.</p><p><strong>Miranda Lambert Fans Are Digging Texan Cody Johnson:</strong></p><p><strong>Is This Where Miranda Lambert&nbsp;Got Married?&nbsp;</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskajBprvFnKaupqSnxm%2BvzqZmpqGilrulrYylmKaalafBbsPEnZuippdisbOx0qxm</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 DashJ - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
