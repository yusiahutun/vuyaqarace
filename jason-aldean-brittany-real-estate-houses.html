They didn't quite say they were selling it, though.</p><p>The Aldean family was said to be moving to a new piece of property they'd purchased in Nashville.&nbsp;Brittany&nbsp;told fans they began building this new house&nbsp;February of 2022 and were about to move into it.</p><p>Then,&nbsp;they seemed to&nbsp;flip a wildcard on us,&nbsp;packing up&nbsp;again&nbsp;to&nbsp;<a href=#>move</a>&nbsp;into a newly-purchased home in Florida. As far as real estate goes — and where Aldeans spend most of their time —&nbsp;was up in the air as far as fans knew.</p><p>I recently had the chance to sit down with Jason Aldean in the <a href=#>Taste of Country Nights</a> studios in Nashville, so I wanted to dive in and see what was really going on with the Aldeans' home life.</p><p>I asked Aldean to clear up the real estate stuff for us and let us know where the family is living. Aldean has two girls from a previous marriage and two youngins, a boy and a girl, with Brittany.</p><p>Here's what he said:</p><p>"A while back, we ended up buying this place on a golf course,&nbsp;to be a part of it&nbsp;so I could&nbsp;go play golf. It's here in town. But so we bought this house and I think people thought we sold our main house to do that. We still have our main house."</p><p>"We just like real estate and buying things and using them for a few years, enjoy them, then we'll sell 'em. We always say that we do things for this season of our life. While we're in the mood, it's like, 'Hey,&nbsp;let's go do this and do that for a while, then we'll sell it and go do something else for a while.'"</p><p>The Aldeans are living their best&nbsp;lives out there, doing what they want to do with their hard-earned money.&nbsp;Aldean just wrapped up his&nbsp;Highway Desperado&nbsp;Tour in a big way: By&nbsp;<a href=#>bringing out</a>&nbsp;wrestling icon Hulk Hogan.</p><p>Check out the <a href=#>full interview</a> with Jason Aldean on this week's episode of Taste of Country Nights, On Demand, wherever you get your podcasts.</p><p>Evan Paul is the host of&nbsp;<a class="x_x_ContentPasted0 x_ContentPasted0" title="Original URL: https://tasteofcountry.com/category/taste-of-country-nights/.

The spectacular property affords the singer and his family the opportunity to walk out their back door and down a bridge to their own private beach, and the exterior of the villa features a courtyard with iron gates that includes gas lanterns, a swimming pool and a fountain.</p><p>The home's interior includes a downstairs with an open floorplan and oversized windows, chiseled stone floors, a gourmet kitchen, a bedroom and study and a fireplace, with coffered ceilings throughout. The upstairs of the home includes two separate master bedrooms that both overlook the Gulf, as well as two more bedrooms that each have their own attached bathrooms.</p><p>The stunning home is also set for whatever weather might blow in from the Gulf. Built in 2005, the house features all-impact windows and doors, as well as Geo-Thermal heating and cooling, cellulose insulation, foam ceiling and floor insulation and more.</p><p class=photogallery-credit>Gallery Credit: <a href=#>Sterling Whitaker</a></p><h2 class=photogallery-title>Top 50 Jason Aldean Songs: His Greatest Hits + Best Deep Cuts</h2>The best <a href=#>Jason Aldean</a> songs are spread out among his 11 studio albums. Find singles and deep cuts from his self-titled debut album high on this list, right alongside more recent hits and duets from Macon and Georgia.<p>Taste of Country asked readers for input and did a deep dive into Aldeans' full catalog of songs to identify those worthy of this top songs list, and those that simply aren't. Spoiler alert: A few radio singles are missing, and several album tracks rank inside the Top 20. Sales and chart success helped us round out the Top 50. Do you agree with No. 1?</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskajBprvFnKaupqSnxm%2BvzqZmo5mjpLturcudnJqmXZe%2FqsDTmqWyZaKarq15xKyrmqyVYrWwwdKeqmg%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 DashJ - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
