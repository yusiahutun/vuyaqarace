However, he decided to take classes for biochemical engineering at the University of Iowa because he wanted to find a cure for his twin brother’s cerebral palsy and cardiomyopathy. Despite the good cause, Kutcher decided to drop out, a year after he began, to pursue a career in modelling.</p><p>Today, Kutcher is a tv and movie star, a heartthrob, and a successful venture capitalist. “I pursued something I was passionate about, and for 22 years, I haven’t felt like I’ve worked a day.

However, he dropped out and enrolled at Occidental College in Los Angelos to study middle eastern affairs.</p><p>With studying towards a college degree seemingly not for Affleck, he dropped out a second time, but luckily a short period after he began working on a screenplay called Good Will Hunting with his friend Matt Damon. Affleck now has a degree after being awarded an honorary degree from Brown University in 2013.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Brad Pitt</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.glossyfied.com/file/2021/11/brad-pitt.jpg><p>Brad Pitt might have had a column on a news publication had he not changed his career path before graduating from the University of Missouri in Journalism.
