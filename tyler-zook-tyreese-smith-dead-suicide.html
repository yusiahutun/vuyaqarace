They found a 2014 Hyundai Santa Fe on its side and located a 16-year-old passenger, later identified as Tyreese Smith (right), "under the vehicle, deceased." An 18-year-old passenger, Amalie Wendt, was also at the scene and treated for "serious injuries."

Per <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">local reports</a>, Smith died of mechanical asphyxia due to multiple traumatic injuries in the crash and the coroner's office ruled his death accidental.</p><p>While at the crash site, police were then dispatched to a shooting at a residence about a mile away at 1:54am, where they found a 17-year-old "deceased from a self-inflicted gunshot wound."

Wendt, per police, had recently graduated. Zook and Smith were both on the varsity football team.</p><p>Speaking with <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Lancaster Online</a>, Smith's mother described son Tyreese and Tyler as the best of friends. "Normally, you never saw one without the other," she told the publication. "They were really funny. They were always goofing around and having fun."</p><p>"Ty will be remembered for his playful personality and his ability to bring joy to others," read his <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">obituary</a>. "He had an infectious smile that naturally attracted people to him. He was dedicated to his family and will be remembered for his countless selfless acts."</p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Zook's obituary </a>says he was "preceded in death by his best friend, Tyreese Smith, of Lancaster," adding that "his favorite place to be was on the football field." His obituary continued, "Tyler enjoyed spending time with his teammates both on and off the field. He also enjoyed hunting, fishing, spending time with family, and being at the beach."</p><p>GoFundMe pages have been started to help cover funeral costs for both <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Smith</a> and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Zook</a>.</p><p>If you or someone you know is struggling with depression or has had thoughts of harming themselves or taking their own life, get help.
