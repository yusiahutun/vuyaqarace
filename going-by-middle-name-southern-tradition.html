And all were born in, you guessed it, the South.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=2 class="css-x6js8g et3p2gv0">If you, too, go by your middle name, you'd probably love the chance to convince any parents who are considering naming their child this way not to. As a middle-nameite myself, I'm all too familiar with the roll-call confusion every first day of school, the mail addressed to two different names, and downright tuning out your first name when it's called at, say, a doctor's office waiting room. (Oh wait, that's me, you think.)</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=4 class="css-x6js8g et3p2gv0">But how did this inconvenient practice get started in the first place? I was in my early 20s the first time someone suggested it was a "Southern thing." I was out to dinner with a coworker when she spotted my first name on my credit card, inevitably kicking off the same exchange I've had 2,984 times in my life, which goes something like:</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=7 class="css-x6js8g et3p2gv0">Friend: Why did you decide to start going by your middle name?</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=9 class="css-x6js8g et3p2gv0">Me: I didn't. My parents have always called me this.</p><h6 class="css-5zz7ok e6pr2lz3"><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p0"></span><span class="css-8lle59 e6pr2lz1">Related Story</span><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p1"></span></h6><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=13 class="css-x6js8g et3p2gv0">But this time, my colleague, who was from New York, informed me that she thought calling children by their middle names was a Southern tradition. I'd lived in the South (Georgia and Texas, to be specific) my whole life up until that point and knew plenty of people who went by their middle names, so I wouldn't have exactly known the difference. (In the South, they're not Southern traditions, they're just...traditions.)</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=15 class="css-x6js8g et3p2gv0">A cursory internet search doesn't return a definitive answer, and neither does there seem to be an expert on the topic, but there's lots of anecdotal evidence to support the theory. The best explanation seems to stem from Southerners' penchant for keeping a name going down the line, especially for males. You end up with John Smith Jr., III, and IV in one family, and calling a child by his middle name is an easy way to distinguish between him and his father. In my family, my grandfather, father, and brother all have the same first name, so my dad and brother are known by their middle names.</p><h6 class="css-5zz7ok e6pr2lz3"><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p0"></span><span class="css-8lle59 e6pr2lz1">Related Story</span><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p1"></span></h6><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=19 class="css-x6js8g et3p2gv0">It doesn't help that, as retired Middle Tennessee State sociology professor Ben Austin <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=http://www.upi.com/Expert-Unusual-names-a-Southern-tradition/73221264459010/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=explained class="body-link css-a3mbhf et3p2gv0">explained</a>, "So many generations of families have lived in the same place."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=21 class="css-x6js8g et3p2gv0">But how does that explain the vast number of Southern women, who presumably weren't named after their mothers, who go by their middle moniker? Psychologist Elisabeth Waugman, Ph.D., <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/whats-in-name/201406/the-psychology-double-names data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=writes class="body-link css-a3mbhf et3p2gv0">writes</a> that Southerners have a tradition of giving girls "double names" — Mary Ann, Katherine Leigh, Sarah Beth — which has its roots in the "mass migration of the Scots and Irish into the South, with large concentrations in Appalachia." Both names used together, Waugman explained, have a lyrical "three beat" quality, which was "popular in 19th-century lyric poetry when many European immigrants were coming to the U.S."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=23 class="css-x6js8g et3p2gv0">Garland Pollard, a Virginia native living south of Tampa, Florida, uses his middle name because he is the fourth in a line of men with the same name. "At least in my family, the middle name was more of an early 20th-century invention," says Pollard, the director of communications for the Diocese of Southwest Florida and former editor of Virginia Living magazine. "Looking at genealogy charts, I seem to have many 19th-century ancestors with only a first and a last name."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=25 class="css-x6js8g et3p2gv0">Pollard points out that the use of a middle name, in general, can "preserve a surname that has disappeared from a bloodline." Reese Witherspoon, for example, is Laura Jeanne Reese Witherspoon — Reese is her mother's maiden name.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=27 class="css-x6js8g et3p2gv0">Pollard posits that, because the United States is not a monarchy, people dislike having a number attached to their name, so having the same first name (but not the middle) continue down the family tree makes more sense. The tradition that started with boys probably carried over to girls once it became popular and accepted practice.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=29 class="css-x6js8g et3p2gv0"><strong data-redactor-tag=strong>Follow Country Living on <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.pinterest.com/countryliving/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=P class="body-link css-a3mbhf et3p2gv0">P</a><a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.pinterest.com/countryliving/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=interest class="body-link css-a3mbhf et3p2gv0">interest</a>.</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLvUp6ursZyew6q6xmeaqKVfobansY6aa2psaWV8qLvIp55mmqliuqqww6WcZqaRorJuv86uq6GdoqN6tb7AnaCtoZ%2BjfA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 DashJ - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
