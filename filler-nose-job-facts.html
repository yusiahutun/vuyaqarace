The before-and-after photos are so unbelievable that you might just think the "lunchtime nose job" is too good to be true—an Instagram fable, if you will. It's not. We caught up with Rivkin to help separate myth from fact, and to get all the information you need to know about the new nose job.</p><h2 data-node-id=2 class="body-h2 css-p3fpzg emevuu60">Temporary Or Permanent—It's Your Choice</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=4 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Most cosmetic fillers are temporary. The injections last anywhere from three months to two years, depending on the type you choose, before slowly dissolving. People often scoff at the procedure's fleetingness—why even do it if you're going to have to go back over and over again? Rivkin will start a patient off with a temporary filler ("<span data-redactor-tag=span data-verified=redactor id=docs-internal-guid-c3245f5e-395e-575c-ced9-76c471780560>Voluma lasts for a year and half, and it's reversible and natural looking," he says) before moving on to a permanent one. "Once the temporary one dissolves, I have them come back and use Bellafill, a permanent filler." While you can correct your nose using Voluma in one 15-minute session, Bellafill—a collagen-based injectable used typically used to treat <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.harpersbazaar.com/beauty/skin-care/g3773/best-dark-spot-correctors/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="acne scars" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">acne scars</a>—takes three spaced-out sessions to see the final result that can last years.</span></p><h2 data-node-id=6 class="body-h2 css-p3fpzg emevuu60">It's Dangerous In The Wrong Hands</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=7 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">All injections come with risks—swelling, bruising, bleeding. But the nose is a particularly delicate and tricky area of the face. "<span data-redactor-tag=span data-verified=redactor id=docs-internal-guid-c3245f5e-39a0-ac1c-d340-9648ff7209c4>I think that people need to understand the safety principles of injecting, and a have a healthy fear of the nose. In terms of what's dangerous, the nose ranks up there as the most dangerous," says Rivkin. That's because the blood supply to the nose is quite weak, particularly in noses that have already undergone a previous surgery. "I<span data-redactor-tag=span data-verified=redactor id=docs-internal-guid-c3245f5e-39a2-a090-db3a-e12cbe2840d3>f you put a whole bunch of filler into the tip or nostril, you can overrun the blood supply to your skin and cut it off," he says. This isn't a procedure you want to shop around for on Groupon. Speak to your doctor about their experience with non-surgical nose jobs—and be sure they outline all the potential risks.</span></span></p><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p0"></span>"In terms of what's dangerous, the nose ranks up there as the most dangerous."<span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p1"></span><h2 data-node-id=10 class="body-h2 css-p3fpzg emevuu60">It's Not Just For Bridge Bumps<br></h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=11 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">One of the most ideal candidates for a non-surgical nose job are those who have a pronounced bump on the bridge of their nose. Here, double board-certified plastic surgeon <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.instagram.com/omarhussainmd/?hl=en" data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Omar Hussain" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">Omar Hussain</a> fills the areas above and below a dorsal hump on one of his patients to create the illusion of a perfectly straight nose.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=12 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">"<span data-redactor-tag=span data-verified=redactor id=docs-internal-guid-c3245f5e-39ab-268d-0655-8d582804c9c7>The most important lesson is that people think you're adding to the nose, but you're actually adding and making it look smaller," says Rivkin. But you can also correct a droopy tip (filler will help lift it up) and mildly crooked noses (filler will correct any sharp angles). People who are not a candidate? "If it's<span data-redactor-tag=span data-verified=redactor id=docs-internal-guid-c3245f5e-39ad-6f74-8670-3f9fac29e375> just too big I can't make it smaller, if the bump is too big or too extreme, or if they had their nose broken, I can't help with that. Or if the nose is too thick, I can't thin it out," he says, noting that a traditional rhinoplasty would be needed in those cases. There is one exception, however. In certain cases where scar tissue is causing a widening of the nose, a shot of steroids can help it subtly shrink (crazy, right?). "<span data-redactor-tag=span data-verified=redactor id=docs-internal-guid-c3245f5e-39b0-5459-3b63-319aeb6e8aab>You don't want to inject too much, a little bit is okay and when it works it's permanent—you're dissolving the scar tissue under the skin," notes Rivkin.</span></span></span></p><h2 data-node-id=14 class="body-h3 css-11vz3s8 emevuu60">See Dr. Omar Hussain's Liquid Nose Job Demonstration on Harper's BAZAAR's <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.tiktok.com/@harpersbazaar data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=TikTok class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">TikTok</a></h2><h2 data-node-id=16 class="body-h3 css-11vz3s8 emevuu60"></h2><h2 data-node-id=17 class="body-h2 css-p3fpzg emevuu60">It Can Cost More Than Rhinoplasty</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=18 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The average cost of a rhinoplasty in the United States is $5,046. For a temporary non-surgical nose job using Voluma, you'll end up spending about $2,500 a year. And if you eventually choose to go permanent with Bellafill, you'll spend $1,500 a session for three sessions, totaling $4,500. So while it's not a cost-effective solution, it does mean you won't have to wheeled into surgery. And it can drastically improve the appearance of noses that are too fragile for a revision rhinoplasty.</p><h2 data-node-id=19 class="body-h2 css-p3fpzg emevuu60">Recovery Is Easy</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=20 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">If we were to create an injectable pain scale, <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.harpersbazaar.com/beauty/hair/a41914161/what-is-hair-botox/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=Botox class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">Botox</a> would be at the bottom (you can barely feel it) and cheek injections would be positioned near the top (it burns like the fire of 10,000 fiery suns). Lip injections would fall somewhere in the middle. And a non-surgical nose job? All accounts say it's nearly painless. Rivkin uses a topical cream to numb the area—though <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.harpersbazaar.com/beauty/skin-care/g39387475/best-ice-roller-for-face/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=ice class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">ice</a> helps, too—and says the pain is moderate, with the tip of the nose being the most sensitive area. "It's a real lunchtime procedure. People can generally go right back to work," he says. "You can be a little red or a little bruised for a week, but we have <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.harpersbazaar.com/beauty/skin-care/g31045530/best-laser-hair-removal/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=lasers class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">lasers</a> that can fix that too."</p><h6 class="css-ok56rr e94w1mj3"><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p0"></span><span class="css-8lle59 e94w1mj1">Related:</span><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p1"></span></h6><span class="css-1s9owpq ev8dhu51"><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/rover/profile_photos/a5b794e4-ba0e-4527-9e9d-e98142b9fbef_1526586861.jpg alt="Headshot of Jenna Rosenstein" title="Headshot of Jenna Rosenstein" width=100% height=100% decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></span><p>Jenna Rosenstein is the Beauty Director at Harper's BAZAAR across both print and digital.
