Walker (played by real life singer <a href=#>Ryan Bingham</a>) and Kayce drive off to the train station, but the catch is that only one of them knows what that really means. If you've watched all four-and-a-half seasons of Yellowstone, you know how this ends, but those catching up on CBS may be wondering if this is it for the character.</p><p>This sequence is a big part of this week's <a href=#>Dutton Rules </a>podcast conversation.</p><p>Young Beth also&nbsp;caught the podcast hosts' attention, but the most important thing this week is Jamie Dutton's unraveling.
