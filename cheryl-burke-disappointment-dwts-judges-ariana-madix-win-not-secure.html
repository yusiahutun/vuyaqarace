[Xochitl is] the <a class=hm-link href=#>best technical dancer</a>, but it just depends on people at home voting.

For me, that's Ariana. I think maybe she has that leg up because <a class=hm-link href=#>she's so used to reality television</a> that all she knows is how to be her authentic self and that comes across on a show like this. <a class=hm-link href=#>She's not hiding behind anything</a>. <strong>I believe Ariana will win.</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/72030f53c2ab-170401cw101025.jpg><h2 dir=ltr><strong>What makes </strong><a class=hm-link href=#>Alyson Hannigan</a><strong> the perfect underdog</strong></h2><p id=es3LctrXTYf data-wc=41>We know she's happy to be there, she is the underdog, so I think there's no pressure, and sometimes people with no pressure end up doing really well on this show.

She made the finale, she didn't think she was going to <a class=hm-link href=#>make it to Taylor Swift night</a>. I'm sure it's not easy, and I'm sure she rehearsed harder than anybody because it doesn't come [naturally.] <strong>But man has she definitely inspired millions of women around the United States for sure.</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/34489a2ddd1d-170360cw00270.jpg><h2 dir=ltr><strong>Judges need to give more constructive criticism&nbsp;</strong></h2><p id=eg_K2areGyPo data-wc=60>As the judges, [they] should be doing their job. It would be best if the judges gave more constructive criticism because they didn't do it with [Alyson and Sasha Farber] the previous week, either. Maybe it would have helped this week, to just give one or two pieces of feedback; I'm not asking for a lot, but they need feedback.&nbsp;</p><p id=e3-6VwWzcbCg data-wc=33>[And] as a viewer, we need it too, like we need to hear <a class=hm-link href=#>[the judges'] expertise in this whole show</a>.
