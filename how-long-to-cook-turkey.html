It'll cook faster and more evenly, and the meat will be more tender. If you've got a big crowd, you can even cook two small turkeys.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=3 class="css-x6js8g et3p2gv0">Either way, if your turkey is frozen, you'll need to thaw it. The best and safest way to do this is in the fridge, and you'll want to start several days ahead. Here are some general thaw times:</p><ul data-node-id=5 class="css-9wvcvc et3p2gv0"><li>Under 7 pounds: 1 day</li><li>8 to 11 pounds: 2 days</li><li>12 to 15 pounds: 3 days</li><li>16 to 20 pounds: 4 days</li><li>21 pounds or more: 5 days at least.</li></ul><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=6 class="css-x6js8g et3p2gv0">If you need a quicker method, check out our <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.countryliving.com/food-drinks/a29738343/how-long-to-thaw-frozen-turkey/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Turkey Thawing Guide" class="body-link css-a3mbhf et3p2gv0">Turkey Thawing Guide</a>.</p><h2 data-node-id=7 class="body-h2 css-1dtpnw8 et3p2gv0">Next: Air-Dry the Turkey</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=8 class="css-x6js8g et3p2gv0">After the frozen turkey is thawed, remove all the packaging and wrapping, and put it on a <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.amazon.com/Nordic-Ware-43171-Set-Prism-Nonstick/dp/B07BZX17ZM data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="baking sheet with a rack" data-vars-ga-product-id=9d99df36-78a0-4633-a0a3-6c7d7f900a61 data-vars-ga-link-treatment="_t | (not set) | (not set)" data-href=https://www.amazon.com/Nordic-Ware-43171-Set-Prism-Nonstick/dp/B07BZX17ZM data-product-url=https://www.amazon.com/Nordic-Ware-43171-Set-Prism-Nonstick/dp/B07BZX17ZM data-affiliate=true data-affiliate-url=https://www.amazon.com/Nordic-Ware-43171-Set-Prism-Nonstick/dp/B07BZX17ZM data-affiliate-network='{"id":"f2d19a9b-88b2-4e2b-b0f4-2bcc1aef8ac8","site_id":"f30f2c6f-2363-4b03-b482-ae642b94f911","metadata":{},"network":{"id":"469ce69f-4798-416d-9432-eaa9954b4053","name":"Amazon","metadata":{}}}' data-vars-ga-product-price=$0.00 data-vars-ga-product-retailer-id=7d18fbbc-023a-4ff0-b9dd-5b67df311fd1 data-optimizely-button-poc=_t class="body-link product-links css-a3mbhf ebsw2pb0">baking sheet with a rack</a>, so air can circulate around it. Then, pat it dry all over, and season it generously with salt and pepper. Put it back in the fridge for at least an hour, and up to overnight.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=9 class="css-x6js8g et3p2gv0">Letting the skin both season and dry in this way will help ensure a beautifully browned roast turkey with deliciously crispy and flavorful skin. The salt also needs time to penetrate the meat, making it more tender and flavorful.</p><h2 data-node-id=10 class="body-h2 css-1dtpnw8 et3p2gv0">Now: Preheat the Oven and Season the Bird</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=11 class="css-x6js8g et3p2gv0"><strong>We recommend preheating the oven to 325°F and not much higher</strong>. While higher temperatures will cook a turkey faster, they'll also increase the chances that your bird will singe or even burn on the outside before the inside is cooked through. This isn't a weeknight meal that you should be rushing through; <strong>low and slow is the way to go</strong>.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=12 class="css-x6js8g et3p2gv0">The important thing to stress is <strong>hitting that 165ºF mark</strong> with the instant-read thermometer so that you know it's safe to eat. Note: Once you remove your turkey, the temperature will continue rising another 20 degrees or so. So it's okay to pull it out a little before it hits 165°F, as long as it gets there at some point.</p><p><h2 class="css-1c5o6bp e8seki10">ThermoPro ThermoPro Digital Meat Thermometer</h2></p><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# aria-label="$22 at Amazon for ThermoPro Digital Meat Thermometer" data-href=https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07MF18JHT data-product-url=https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07MF18JHT data-affiliate=true data-affiliate-url=https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07MF18JHT data-affiliate-network='{"id":"f2d19a9b-88b2-4e2b-b0f4-2bcc1aef8ac8","site_id":"f30f2c6f-2363-4b03-b482-ae642b94f911","is_active":true,"details":null,"metadata":{},"network":{"id":"469ce69f-4798-416d-9432-eaa9954b4053","name":"Amazon","is_active":true,"business_unit_id":"ad046b46-538b-42cb-aa54-c3d158875ed6","details":"","metadata":{},"created_at":"2021-07-28T16:03:03.241365+00:00","last_updated_at":"2021-07-28T16:03:03.241381+00:00"}}' data-vars-ga-call-to-action="$22 at Amazon" data-vars-ga-media-role data-vars-ga-media-type="Single Product Embed" data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07MF18JHT data-vars-ga-product-brand=ThermoPro data-vars-ga-product-id=7c22dbf3-8464-41b8-9213-4a70d68d4302 data-vars-ga-product-price=$21.99 data-vars-ga-product-retailer-id=7af36bfc-75ec-42f6-ac34-b623d65f8a31 data-vars-ga-product-sem3-brand=ThermoPro data-vars-ga-product-sem3-category=Meat data-vars-ga-link-treatment="sale_t | On Sale" data-optimizely-button-poc=_t data-vars-ga-sku=B07MF18JHT data-vars-ga-magento-tracking=1 class="product-image-link eyaokey0 en6kra60 css-15xslai e1c1bym14"><img alt="ThermoPro Digital Meat Thermometer" title="ThermoPro Digital Meat Thermometer" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/vader-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/1667226599-41dPAcsoq5S._SL500_.jpg width=500 height=500 decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p><h2 class="css-1c5o6bp e8seki10">ThermoPro ThermoPro Digital Meat Thermometer</h2></p><p>Now 19% Off</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=15 class="css-x6js8g et3p2gv0">To season a turkey, you don't need too much: Butter on the skin, along with salt and pepper will suffice.

It simply makes the bird take longer to cook.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=17 class="css-x6js8g et3p2gv0">You can get lots of turkey flavor into the stuffing by using some of the pan drippings when cooking the stuffing on the stove. However, if stuffing the turkey is important to you, we have advice on adjusting cooking times, below.<strong></strong></p><h2 data-node-id=18 class="body-h2 css-1dtpnw8 et3p2gv0">How Long to Cook an Unstuffed Turkey (Recommended)<br></h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=19 class="css-x6js8g et3p2gv0"><strong></strong>The first thing you should do before you embark on cooking a turkey is invest in an instant-read thermometer. <strong>Cooking by temperature is the best and safest way to know when your turkey is ready</strong>. Insert the thermometer into the thickest part of the bird between the breast and part of the thigh (being sure not to hit bone). It's done when the thermometer just reaches 165ºF.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=20 class="css-x6js8g et3p2gv0"><strong>In general, you should plan to cook a turkey for around 15-20 minutes per pound of turkey at 325ºF to get to that temp. </strong>But that's only an estimate! The time will vary based on the exact size of the bird, as well as the size of the oven and how accurate your temperature gauge works, and whether or not the bird is stuffed. That's why we always recommend you use a thermometer to be safe. Here's a quick breakdown of weights and times. At 325°F for an unstuffed turkey:</p><ul data-node-id=21 class="css-9wvcvc et3p2gv0"><li>10-12 pounds: cook 2 3/4 to 3 hours</li><li>15-16 pounds: cook 3 1/2 to 4 hours</li><li>18-20 pounds: cook 4 to 4 1/2 hours</li></ul><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=22 class="css-x6js8g et3p2gv0">For a turkey that is <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.countryliving.com/food-drinks/a28679138/20-lb-turkey-cook-time/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=20-pounds class="body-link css-a3mbhf et3p2gv0">20-pounds</a> or more, settle in for the afternoon. This could take around 4 1/2 to 5 hours.<br></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=23 class="css-x6js8g et3p2gv0"><strong>One note:</strong> We actually don't recommend you cook the stuffing inside the turkey (and the <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.usda.gov/media/blog/2020/11/12/countdown-food-safe-thanksgiving-day-faqs data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="USDA agrees" class="body-link css-a3mbhf et3p2gv0">USDA agrees</a>). It increases the chances the turkey will cook unevenly. It also increases the Thanksgiving turkey cook time and will dry the turkey out.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=24 class="css-x6js8g et3p2gv0">But most importantly: you miss out on the delicious crispy-crunchy bits that you get when the stuffing is cooked in a pan or dish!

You can substitute 1/2 cup dry white wine for extra flavor. If you are sans veggies, you can skip putting liquid in your roasting pan.<br></p><h2 data-node-id=30 class="body-h2 css-1dtpnw8 et3p2gv0">When to Cover a Turkey While Cooking<br></h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=31 class="css-x6js8g et3p2gv0">Start by cooking the turkey uncovered. This will ensure that the skin gets a nice golden brown color.

While in the past cooks recommended either brining or basting a turkey (and Kosher turkeys come pre-brined), modern cooking science has found that those techniques are neither necessary or helpful.<br></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=35 class="css-x6js8g et3p2gv0">One of the best ways to prepare a flavorful turkey is to salt the skin well and then butter the turkey ahead of time. The salt will help tenderize the meat and the fat from the butter will get the skin crispy and delicious, and help keep the meat moist as well.</p><h2 data-node-id=36 class="body-h2 css-1dtpnw8 et3p2gv0">When to Carve the Turkey<br></h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=37 class="css-x6js8g et3p2gv0">For maximum juiciness, <strong>let the turkey rest a good half-hour to 45 minutes</strong> before carving.
