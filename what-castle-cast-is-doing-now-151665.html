The hit show Castle of course! Nathan Fillion starred in the long-running series as Richard Castle, the author of said novels, who decides to work with the homicide division of the New York Police Department in order to solve the crimes (and hopefully, prevent more from happening). The TV show, which premiered back in 2009 and ran until 2016, produced an avid following to this day — thanks to the Castle cast being full of relatable, humorous and compelling characters.</p><p>Some of those favorites are Stana Katic, who played Castle’s love interest Kate Beckett, and Richard’s daughter Alexis Castle (portrayed by Molly C. Quinn). Fans quickly became obsessed with Castle’s life and the characters who surrounded him. Even today, that fervor hasn’t dissipated. After the abrupt cancellation, many fans are still curious what the Castle cast is up to now, years later — and even more curious if they will ever be on screen together again!</p><p class=inline-stn-player></p><p>(Click through to see <a href=#>beloved 90s sitcom stars then and now</a>.)</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Life after Castle and hope for a return</h2><p>“<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">It wasn’t the beautiful send-off that I think maybe you could hope for</a>, but it’s the entertainment industry, it’s a business, I get it,” Nathan Fillion told the New York Post of Castle’s abrupt cancellation. “I don’t take it personally when a show gets canceled — I can’t take it personally, all my shows gets canceled! Look at my resume, it’s a long list of canceled TV shows.” He continued with a laugh, “The fact is, I made a lot of great friends on a really great show. I’m really happy for everything that that show has done for me.”</p><p>Castle&nbsp;star Jon Huertas (who played Javier Esposito) said he would love to return to the show for another season or a reboot following its untimely cancellation. “I would do something&nbsp;Castle-related, for sure, because <a href=#>we didn’t get to end it on our terms</a>,” he said in an exclusive interview with&nbsp;Digital Spy<strong>.</strong> “It would be cool. I’d do it.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Castle cast then and now</h2><p>Although some of the actors have gone on to star in award-winning movies and appear in popular TV shows, others have kept a lower profile.
