That is followed by multiple other concerns like discoloration, fine lines, and wrinkles. An eye primer ensures that it hides all the imperfections to create a smooth base for your eyelid so that you can have a flawless base to do makeup.</p><p>Other than that, an eye primer is an excellent option to add longevity to the eye makeup! It helps in preventing smudging, getting cakey, and settling down in the fine lines which is a genuine concern for people with mature skin.</p><p><h2 class=title>When to Apply Eye Primer?</h2></p><p>The thumb rule is that you should do a proper CTM aka cleansing, toning, and moisturizing, before starting your makeup. After you are done with these, take a little amount of primer and apply it all over your lid up to the eyebrows to create a smooth canvas for your eyeshadows.</p><p>While some use concealer for the same concern, an eye primer holds great benefits to make your eye makeup stay a bit longer, look flawless, and create a smooth base for eyeshadow.</p><p><h2 class=title>How to Choose the Best Eyeshadow Primer?</h2></p><p><strong>a) Formula- </strong>A lightweight formula is always preferable to the other ones.

Any oily texture will cause your makeup to stay a lot lesser than you expected plus it tends to showcase more of your imperfections.</p><p><strong>c) Longevity- </strong>Products that promise you 24 hours of longevity should be picked in the first place to ensure that your eye makeup doesn’t move from the place!</p><p>These best eye primers for mature skin are indeed a one-stop solution for preventing eye makeup from getting cakey. Ensure your creativity is locked in with the right amount of eye primer that only creates a smooth base but also hydrates the skin around the eyes at the same time. With a universally flattering tone, the products make sure you have the coveted canvas you desire for!</p><h2 class=title>FAQ's</h2><p>What is the best way to apply eye primer?</p><p>The best way to apply an eye primer is pretty simple.
