Making history for the school. Wilkins, the all-time leader in rebounds. Wade, the all-time leader in field goal percentage.</p><p>“It’s pretty great to be able to get it finally,” Wilkins said. “I racked up a lot of rebounds last year and always wanted a record so to break one that’s been around 40 plus years, it’s cool to have my name up on the wall.”</p><p>“Coming off the screens well from my teammates and the passing,” Wade said. “My teammates are great passers and I said it last year too. They always looks for me and make sure I’m open.”</p><p>Attacking the rim was a major part of their games, both wanted to improve.</p><p>“The last few years, we had others who could crash the boards and he (Wilkins) would score but this year we have others who can score just as well so he’s focused on other aspects of his game like rebounding and you can see that,” Wade said.</p><p>“He’s (Wade) physical around the room and a lot of us set him up well down there. He finishes well using that physicality and size,” Wilkins said. “He’s huge down low for us.”</p><p>Since the 4th grade, Wade and Wilkins have grown their bond. Where has it become most successful? Vocally.</p><p>“We both really just want to win and that’s the most important thing,” Wilkins said. “We have to get everyone on the same page for that to happen so use using our voice in a positive way, that’s been an emphasis for us this year and why we’ve been able to put together a lot of wins.”</p><p>While both have made a huge impact, without Caden, Asher would not be the player he is today.</p><p>“I let him get on me because it helps grow me as a player. He’s a very driven person and player,” Wade said. “He wants things done and done right. I’d come and be made and not want to play hard but he’s just pushed me and always been there for me and helped me become a better player.”</p><p>The dynamic duo plays their final regular season game together Thursday against West.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7sMHRqqyanJOewaqx0meaqKVfqL2wvtOsZpudpKmyr7DOq52sZaeeuay1zaxksJmUmnq1scCmpJqslah6o7HSrWSfqpmau6W%2FjKucnKeimXqjvsSaop6qo2Q%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 DashJ - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
