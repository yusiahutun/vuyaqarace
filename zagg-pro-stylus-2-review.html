Both models have similar feature sets all around, outside of the first generation requiring you to plug in a USB-C cable to power it. The other main difference here is that the Pro Stylus 2 incorporates a button on the top, similar to a normal pen, which is how you turn it on or off. After 15 minutes, the Pro Stylus 2 will put itself to sleep and you’ll need to use the top button to wake it up. The click is satisfying and I found myself using it as a fidget toy a little as the click was so crisp in both feel and sound.</p><p>But, back on the wireless charging. The Zagg Pro Stylus 2 charges with any Qi-enabled pad (like the included magnetic USB-C charger) and leverages your iPad's magnetic charging area on the side. That's right, the strip along the side of iPads Pro and Air works with more than just <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored nofollow" class="norewrite noskim">Apple Pencil 2</a>. While that side spot might not handle pairing the Zagg Pro Stylus 2 (that's done with a simple click of the top button), it does charge the stylus so it's always ready to go whenever you need it. This was one of the biggest upgrades when Apple launched the Apple Pencil 2 years ago, and now it's available on a stylus that's a fraction of the price.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/wm/2023/12/person-drawing-with-the-zagg-pro-stylus-2-1jpg_53298179373_o.jpg><h2 id=there-rsquo-s-no-real-comparison-with-the-apple-pencil-2-when-it-comes-to-sketching>There’s No Real Comparison With the Apple Pencil 2 When It Comes to Sketching</h2><p>While the Zagg Pro Stylus 2 is a great Apple Pencil alternative, it just can’t measure up whenever it comes to true sketching. You see, the <a href=#>Apple Pencil 2</a> has 4,096 levels of pressure sensitivity. This means that as you’re sketching, just like in real life, the amount of pressure you place on the Apple Pencil dictates how dark or deep the drawing goes in supported apps. The Apple Pencil also features tilt sensitivity so you can angle the stylus and have it draw a wider, lighter stroke, just like with a real pencil.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The Zagg Pro Stylus 2, however, lacks the pressure-sensitive functionality that Apple’s counterpart boasts. This means that whether you’re touching the iPad with a light or heavy hand, the drawing will look the same. This is perfectly fine (and somewhat welcomed) when taking notes or writing on the iPad. However, if you’re an avid sketcher, then the pressure sensitivity is going to be sorely missed here. Zagg did build in the tilt functionality that the Apple Pencil has, though there’s no graduation to it. You either have full power vertical writing or soft side swiping, there is no in-between.</p><p>The lack of pressure sensitivity is also the reason Apple's latest <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored nofollow" class="norewrite noskim">Pencil (USB-C)</a> is probably less interesting to anyone focused on sketching. Zagg's Pro Stylus 2 is probably the better choice for anyone considering Apple's new low-cost stylus.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/wm/2023/12/zagg-logo-on-the-zagg-pro-stylus-2jpg_53298306584_o.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=the-dual-tip-design-is-useful-when-using-your-ipad-for-more-than-just-sketching-or-writing>The Dual-Tip Design Is Useful When Using Your iPad for More Than Just Sketching or Writing</h2><p>A unique feature of the Zagg Pro Stylus 2 is that it has two tips to choose from at a moment’s notice. Of course, you have the normal stylus tip that’s designed for sketching and writing. But, on the top, over the on and off button, is a more rubber-style tip. This is perfect for scrolling through Facebook, your emails, or browsing YouTube without using the actual stylus tip.</p><p>I really only use my Apple Pencil, or any other stylus for that matter, whenever I need to write. This is because I don’t like the way it feels with the pen tip against the screen. Having the softer, rubber tip on the top of the Pro Stylus 2 is really nice for scrolling. It gave tactile feedback thanks to its grippier nature, and it even worked great when swiping backward from page to page whenever I was browsing Facebook Marketplace.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/wm/2023/12/person-pressing-the-power-button-on-the-zagg-pro-stylus-2jpg_53298306174_o.jpg><h2 id=should-you-buy-the-zagg-pro-stylus-2>Should You Buy the Zagg Pro Stylus 2?</h2><p>The <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored nofollow" class="norewrite noskim">Zagg Pro Stylus 2</a> can save you $49 over Apple’s top-end Pencil 2. But we all know that these things go on sale often. The Apple Pencil 2 is routinely available for $90 at many retailers, making it just $10 more than the Pro Stylus 2. But Zagg’s offering does see its fair share of discounts too, dropping into the $65 range now and then.</p><p>If you're someone who just wants to take notes and occasionally sketch, then the savings Zagg brings to the table are likely worth it. You'll keep some extra cash in your pocket and get a pretty solid experience all around. The dual-tip design, wireless charging on the side of your iPad, the whole shebang. However, if your main use of an iPad is sketching, then the Zagg Pro Stylus 2 might not be the best option for you. The fact that it lacks a high level of pressure sensitivity is the main drawback for sketchers and artists, so that's the biggest thing to keep in mind.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/zagg-pro-stylus-2.png><h5 class=display-card-title>Zagg Pro Stylus 2</h5>$59 <span class=regular-price>$80</span> Save $21<p class=display-card-description>The Zagg Pro Stylus 2 is an Apple Pencil alternative that is feature-packed while still saving you money over the official model.
