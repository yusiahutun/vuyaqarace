Sometimes at school, she forces herself to throw up in the bathroom after lunch because she thinks she’s fat.</span></p><p type=p><span type=text>I feel so helpless not being able to help her or talk her out of it. I’ve never gone through what she’s going through so I don’t know how to help.

Professional help is the answer here, but that will only be effective if your friend realises they need to speak to someone.</span></p><p class="BodyParagraph__StyledBlockElement-sc-4sxwoh-0 hVXIcN Body__StyledBodyParagraph-sc-1cgoct-1 UAQBx" type=p><strong type=strong><a href=# class="BodyLink__StyledLink-sc-1uefa8x-0 cJwLWs"><span type=text>Steph Ng recovered from an eating disorder, and now supports others fighting similar battles</span></a></strong></p><p class="BodyParagraph__StyledBlockElement-sc-4sxwoh-0 hVXIcN Body__StyledBodyParagraph-sc-1cgoct-1 UAQBx" type=p><span type=text>You alone won’t be able to convince your friend to stop these actions, but until she does ask for professional help you can continue to support her and care for her. Start by making sure she doesn’t feel abandoned. Keep including her in what you’re doing, and let her decide if she wants to come or not. And remember, it’s not about you.</span></p><p class="BodyParagraph__StyledBlockElement-sc-4sxwoh-0 hVXIcN Body__StyledBodyParagraph-sc-1cgoct-1 UAQBx" type=p><span type=text>I totally understand that you don’t know what she needs, but it’s a good idea to show her you still want to be with her through this difficult time. You could suggest coffee dates or physical activities where weight loss isn’t a focus, such as hiking or playing badminton.</span></p><p class="BodyParagraph__StyledBlockElement-sc-4sxwoh-0 hVXIcN Body__StyledBodyParagraph-sc-1cgoct-1 UAQBx" type=p><strong type=strong><a href=# class="BodyLink__StyledLink-sc-1uefa8x-0 cJwLWs"><span type=text>What it’s like living with anorexia – a personal story</span></a></strong></p><p class="BodyParagraph__StyledBlockElement-sc-4sxwoh-0 hVXIcN Body__StyledBodyParagraph-sc-1cgoct-1 UAQBx" type=p><span type=text>This would allow your friend to see all the fantastic things her body can do for her and maybe help her see how much fun she can have. Treat the activity as a celebration of what your body can do! Bonding and finding a middle ground may change her way of thinking about body image.</span></p><p class="BodyParagraph__StyledBlockElement-sc-4sxwoh-0 hVXIcN Body__StyledBodyParagraph-sc-1cgoct-1 UAQBx" type=p><span type=text>Be wary when talking about food. There’s no need to discuss calories, or what’s good and what’s bad. Talk about food in moderation. The thing about eating disorders is there is an element of guilt and control surrounding food, so it’s best not to talk about it critically, and definitely don’t draw attention to her eating habits.</span></p><p class="BodyParagraph__StyledBlockElement-sc-4sxwoh-0 hVXIcN Body__StyledBodyParagraph-sc-1cgoct-1 UAQBx" type=p><span type=text>Try not to treat it like an elephant in the room, because she is most likely aware of her own difficulties with it and would probably like to keep it to herself.</span></p><p class="BodyParagraph__StyledBlockElement-sc-4sxwoh-0 hVXIcN Body__StyledBodyParagraph-sc-1cgoct-1 UAQBx" type=p><strong type=strong><a href=# class="BodyLink__StyledLink-sc-1uefa8x-0 cJwLWs"><span type=text>How to scale back on self-harm and find healthier coping methods</span></a></strong></p><p class="BodyParagraph__StyledBlockElement-sc-4sxwoh-0 hVXIcN Body__StyledBodyParagraph-sc-1cgoct-1 UAQBx" type=p><span type=text>Lastly, make sure she has a good support network, and give her your time. She may want to speak about it, or she may not, but you can’t force her to. Let her know you are always there to talk, and that you want to make sure she is okay.</span></p><p class="BodyParagraph__StyledBlockElement-sc-4sxwoh-0 hVXIcN Body__StyledBodyParagraph-sc-1cgoct-1 UAQBx" type=p><span type=text>Be aware of any changes – if she starts losing weight rapidly, or is feeling more depressed than usual, then you might need to be more honest with her and tell her you’re worried about her. Hopefully that might encourage her to seek the help she needs.</span></p><p class="BodyParagraph__StyledBlockElement-sc-4sxwoh-0 hVXIcN Body__StyledBodyParagraph-sc-1cgoct-1 UAQBx" type=p><span type=text>When she does decide to reach out, if she isn’t comfortable speaking to her parents right away, you can suggest she speak to your school’s counsellor or social worker. There are also organisations like MindHK that can provide mental health support until she feels ready to speak to her family and doctor.</span></p><p class="BodyParagraph__StyledBlockElement-sc-4sxwoh-0 hVXIcN Body__StyledBodyParagraph-sc-1cgoct-1 UAQBx" type=p><span type=text>I sincerely hope you and your friend find a solution.</span><br class="Body__StyleBr-sc-1cgoct-9 ibAFpb"><span type=text></span><span type=span><strong type=strong><span type=text>Take care,</span><br class="Body__StyleBr-sc-1cgoct-9 ibAFpb"><span type=text>Friend of a Friend.</span></strong></span></p><p class="BodyParagraph__StyledBlockElement-sc-4sxwoh-0 hVXIcN Body__StyledBodyParagraph-sc-1cgoct-1 UAQBx" type=p><strong type=strong><span type=text>Hi Friend,</span></strong><br class="Body__StyleBr-sc-1cgoct-9 ibAFpb"><span type=text>I’m a guy and I really like K-pop.
