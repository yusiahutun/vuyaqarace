"Just by the sheer fact that she had control over me. She did it strategically. She knew that I was in a vulnerable place in my life and I was desperate for something and she targeted me for that."</p><p>Allison's alleged control over India included dietary restrictions, with India only allowed to consume 500 calories or less a day.</p><p>"Before eating anything I had to ask permission -- 'Master may I please have 90 calories,'" India told the outlet.</p><p>The DOS indoctrination culminated in a secret ceremony one night where "slaves" were branded on their pelvic regions with the initials of NXIVM's leader, Keith Raniere.</p><p>"I had two women holding my hands and my feet so I wouldn't convulse," India recalled to People.

"And we were sleep deprived. We were starved. We were coerced."</p><p>"You don't just decide to be branded. You're coerced into being branded."</p><p>But the true nature of the DOS program was eventually revealed, as the "slaves" were allegedly being groomed for Raniere's sexual gratification.</p><p>"One of my first commands was to seduce Keith," India told People. "Allison said it was to make me feel less vulnerable. And I wanted to believe her."</p><p>"I didn't want to see it as sexual abuse," she continued. "I feel shame and embarrassment about what happened but I also have forgiveness for myself. Women who experience this kind of abuse do strange things in their mind to be okay with it."</p><p>She went so far as to call the "sexual relationship" with Raniere as "rape" in an interview with <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Vanity Fair</a>.</p><p>Raniere was found guilty of sex trafficking, racketeering, forced labor conspiracy and possession of child pornography in 2019.

I will fiercely never let that happen again, and be much more watchful and mindful of people," Catherine told Vanity Fair.</p><p>"People go, 'Well, I'll never be sucked into a cult.' But quite frankly, the dynamic is very similar to a controlling, abusive relationship," she continued. "And Keith was not only a cult leader, he was a sexual predator. You look at what R. Kelly did, you look at Epstein -- the system in place that they designed in order to be able to get access to women is the same. They had enforcers; they had people who developed trust with young women. The more we bring light to this kind of predatory behavior and expose it, the safer it will be for young women."</p><p>India said she eventually saw the light with the help of intensive therapy and a deprogrammer, but it wouldn't have been possible without her mother's unwavering support.</p><p>"I don't think anybody thinks that they could lose their life, but still be here. But the reality is that my life was hijacked by this group," she explained to People. "And the fact that I get a second chance to actually just have my life and be like a normal 29 year old -- and not have everything be lost, and be one of these women that is going to spend the rest of their life either in jail or under house arrest, or with the mark of Keith Raniere -- is remarkable to me that I get to have this. And that's because of what she [Catherine] did."</p><p>Now India is looking forward to a healthy, happy life with her fiancé.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmisn6Szoq6NnKamZ2Jlf3F7kGlmamxfo8Wqwsxmqq6qpp7DsL6MoqWdoZFivLmxzZucq59dmLmitcysZKaZo6mys3nApaOiq5%2Bjeq6twqRkm6SRmLiurcilnJ1lmJq%2FbsPIrZ9mpqWZsm68x6irqKtf</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 DashJ - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
