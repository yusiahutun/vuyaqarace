I absolutely adore travel, and even made it around the world backpacking by myself for a year. Needless to say, I know a thing or two about <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>smart packing</a>. When the world shut down and the option to travel was removed from our fingertips, it became all the more important to exercise our freedom to take a trip when it opened up again. Knowing this, more and more brands conveniently began crafting travel bags that accommodated the new wave of travelers — simplifying, organizing, and smoothing out suitcases and bags.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-1 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">We tested said bags in our labs and in real life, doing so much as throwing suitcases onto the floor and seeing how they endured. As we boarded planes, we observed how quickly we could reach for our passports, and whether there was a safe space for our laptops to fit into. We took note of how smoothly wheels rolled over the French cobblestone streets or how heavy a duffel bag felt on our shoulders. Thus, we were able to compile this handy dandy list of 12 best travel bags and carry-on suitcases, based on our own personal experiences.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-overall-dagne-dover-landon-neoprene-carryall-bag></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Overall</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Dagne Dover Landon Carryall Bag</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/up9rD6JRpyRc4oMGlotVXH1Q2ic=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/dagne-dover-landon-neoprene-carryall-bag-d7b431396ad84cc7b287dcf44aa0e74b.jpg"><p>Our Ratings</p><ul class=product-record__attribute-ratings-list><li class=rating-list-item><p>Capacity</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Design</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Portability</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Value</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>3.5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Durability</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>3.8</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li></ul><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>It comes with ample amounts of sleeves, pockets, and even a shoe bag.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love: </strong>Neoprene is prone to creasing.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-2 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">We’re big fans of Dagne Dover’s neoprene collection, having tested their <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>belt bags </a>and <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>backpacks</a> already. We weren’t surprised, therefore, when this Carryall Bag impressed us just as much as their other products. With inside pockets (both slip and zip), we were able to place a laptop into the sleeve in addition to a water bottle and a passport into their dedicated slots. Still, there was plenty of room in the main compartment for all our clothes. Included in the bundle are two removable pouches — a shoe bag and a mesh zip pouch — as well.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-3 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Most notably, the top zip extends out an extra few inches, maximizing the space to stuff our cute weekend outfits. If we didn’t need the extra space, we could clip the sides down to keep everything looking compact. Dagne Dover also offers the bag in five sizes, ensuring there’s an option that’s just right for you. Lastly, there’s an outer slip intended to be used over a suitcase handle, so the bag could stay safe and flush against our carry-on. While neoprene is very soft and lightweight, it is prone to creasing, we noticed. Still, its durability makes up for it, and we know we’ll be using this year after year.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-4 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Dimensions:</strong> 20.5” L x 10” W x 10.5” H |<strong> Materials: </strong>Premium neoprene | <strong>Colors:&nbsp;</strong>9</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-budget-ll-bean-boat-and-tote-zip-top></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Budget</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>L.L.

Bean Boat and Tote bag is famous for a reason. After owning this bag for just six months, InStyle’s Associate Fashion Commerce Editor Hayley Prokos came to learn just how sturdy the canvas tote is. Not only that, but it’s become her go-to for basically all occasions, be it a personal item on a plane, a carryall for the beach, or an overnight tote to hold a change of clothes, shoes, and toiletry bag. (She uses the large size.) “Since the canvas maintains its shape when open, it’s extremely easy to pack. The only drawback is that it doesn't have any built-in compartments, but that hasn’t really bothered me, as I tend to keep small things in removable pouches that I can shuffle around in the bag,” she says. The large is fairly deep, so users can likely fit their things into it sans-problem. The fact that it’s monogrammable is just the icing on the cake. Choose between four different sizes and even two different top handle lengths — Prokos owns both the long and the short, swapping between them based on her needs.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-8 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Dimensions:</strong> 10.5” L x 5” W x 9.5” H&nbsp; |<strong> Materials: </strong>Polyester | <strong>Colors: </strong>13</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-splurge-coach-gotham-duffle></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Splurge</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Coach Gotham Duffle</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Coach Gotham Leather Duffle Bag" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/v_SjBX6CVfgA_Uu4Y1LlmSdXwtY=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Coach-Gotham-Leather-Duffle-Bag-cf594a847b844a8ba60111b5736027fe.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Coach</p></span><p>Our Ratings</p><ul class=product-record__attribute-ratings-list><li class=rating-list-item><p>Capacity</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Portability</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Ease of Use</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Value</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li></ul><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>The high-end leather and stitchings feel substantial, ensuring the bag will last a lifetime.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love: </strong>There aren’t a lot of compartments.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-11 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">We want the items that we splurge on to be items we keep forever, like this Gotham Duffle bag from Coach. While <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>visiting the Coach store</a> we had the pleasure of handling this deliciously smooth leather duffle and were impressed with how spacious it was. It’s likely that Mary Poppins bought her infinity bag from the same maker, considering how much we could fit in it. Although it’s not boasting a lot of compartments, it’s ideal for rolling up all of our clothes and shoes into the open space. The glove-tanned leather feels sturdy and substantial, making us feel confident it would endure a ton of tossing, shoving, and rough TSA handling. The minimalist and unisex aesthetic also ensures it won’t go out of style, so while the initial payment might seem like a lot, it’s really a steal if you divide it by the number of years for which you’re about to use it.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-12 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Dimensions: </strong>19.75” L x&nbsp; 9” W x 11.5” H | <strong>Materials: </strong>Leather |<strong> Colors:&nbsp;</strong>2</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-leather-madewell-the-essential-overnight-bag-in-leather></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Leather</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Madewell Overnight Bag in Leather</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Madewell The Essential Overnight Bag in Leather" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/wvci_AgqYNZ8mfv1kk93cEetfxA=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/madewell-the-essential-overnight-bag-in-leather-36ca141f55f545969816333a682b0dee.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Madewell</p></span><p>Our Ratings</p><ul class=product-record__attribute-ratings-list><li class=rating-list-item><p>Capacity</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Portability</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Ease of Use</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Value</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li></ul><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>The leather has only gotten better after four years of use.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love: </strong>There is no laptop sleeve.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-15 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">While many people are familiar with (and in love with) <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Madewell’s tote bag</a>, we found all the similar great qualities in their overnight bag, plus Alpha. This option is a lot larger than their tote, but still small enough to fit under the seat in front of us. We’ve had this bag for over four years now, and the exterior leather has only gotten better in our opinion. It has endured all our not-so-gentle trips, protecting what’s inside even as we threw it into the trunk of a car.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-16 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Although there are two slip pockets in the interior where we typically keep our passport and phone, it doesn’t have a laptop sleeve, unfortunately. The bag gets rounded out as we stuff it with clothes, so it’s not the most laptop-friendly. Still, the combination of this weekender with a carry-on suitcase has saved us tons of money by not needing to check in a bag, while probably bringing the same amount of stuff as we would with a large suitcase.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-17 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Dimensions: </strong>22.75” L x 13.37” W x 18” H | <strong>Materials: </strong>Leather | <strong>Colors:&nbsp;</strong>2</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-tote-bis-the-east-to-west-tote></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Tote</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Béis East To West Tote</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="B&amp;eacute;is The East To West Tote" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/aXKCEvIo60D1EaTtE5gRQotPOT4=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/beis-the-east-to-west-tote-575863be62d3464eadc32bff9cb1dd2f.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Beis</p></span><p>Our Ratings</p><ul class=product-record__attribute-ratings-list><li class=rating-list-item><p>Capacity</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Portability</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Ease of Use</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Value</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li></ul><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>There is a compartment for absolutely everything.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love: </strong>The top zipper doesn’t close all the way.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-20 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Shay Mitchell’s company dedicated to all things travel didn’t miss a thing when it came to designing the perfect travel tote — it’s compartment-galore in and around this bag. We found pouches for our water bottles, a sleeve for our laptop, a zippered slit for our on-flight toiletries, two slots for our passport and phone, and even two pen hooks (key for someone who loves to journal on the plane).</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-21 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Inside the exterior zipped pocket, there is a key leash, so that we may never have to rummage through our million things at the door. In the past year that we’ve owned this bag, it quickly became a life-saver of a tote, especially as people who are never on time and can’t be sorting through a black hole when we’re being pushed through a line. And yes, it comes with a slit for a suitcase handle as well, so even though we could carry it by the top handle or the shoulder strap, we don’t have to. The only con is that the top doesn’t zip all the way, which means extra attention needs to be paid in high-theft areas.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-22 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Dimensions: </strong>9.06” L x 7.13” W x 14.17” H |<strong> Materials: </strong>Recycled polyester |<strong> Colors:&nbsp;</strong>2</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-compartmentalized-lipault-lost-in-berlin-24h-bag></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Compartmentalized</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Lipault Lost In Berlin 24H Bag</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Lipault Lost In Berlin 24H Bag" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/-bfl9np9gdy-8mLjJgODwoj9Ies=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/lipault-lost-in-berlin-24h-bag-9a883aecddbe4cb0867acd4457bc29f4.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Lipault</p></span><p>Our Ratings</p><ul class=product-record__attribute-ratings-list><li class=rating-list-item><p>Capacity</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Portability</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Ease of Use</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Value</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li></ul><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>The cushiony exterior keeps everything safe on the inside.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love: </strong>It’s not big enough to carry a range of shoe options.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-25 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">We’ve been using this bag not just on our travels, but to the gym as well, giving it a bigger bang for its buck. It’s got two generously sized and zipped pockets on the exterior, making items like passports, phones, and chapsticks easy to grab and safe from theft. Thanks to the cushiony and soft exterior, our valuables on the inside always remain safe. There are even more compartments on the inside that are either zipped or meshed. And of course, a laptop sleeve can be found for anyone looking to use it on a business trip. As a little extra bonus, we love how the bag folds flat when not in use — it’s easy to store it away without taking up too much closet space. Overall, it’s not as big as some of the other bags we tested. At most, we’d feel comfortable packing one extra pair of shoes, but not a whole lot more.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-26 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Dimensions: </strong>17.3” L x 9.8” W x 11.4” H | <strong>Materials: </strong>Polyester | <strong>Colors:&nbsp;</strong>6</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-convertible-caraa-studio-tote-leather-in-black></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Convertible</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Caraa Studio Tote</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt=caraa-studio-tote-leather-large-in-black style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/3YH_4PtRgJCauCp01wGoLWLapoY=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/caraa-studio-tote-leather-large-in-black-e25e69f8cb4f4e688257e97991615d56.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Caraa</p></span><p>Our Ratings</p><ul class=product-record__attribute-ratings-list><li class=rating-list-item><p>Capacity</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Portability</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Ease of Use</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Value</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li></ul><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>You can convert the tote into a backpack.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love: </strong>The shoe compartment can only fit smaller or flat shoes.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-29 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">At first glance, this black leather tote looks like any standard bag. But upon further inspection, we fell deeper and deeper in love with all the smart benefits it offers. There are removable straps that turn the tote into a backpack, so we could move around with our hands free. Because they are removable, they don’t dangle around and get in the way when we simply want to use it as a tote either.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-30 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">We found a side zip that we used as a shoe compartment, although it only fits flat sandals or smaller shoes (i.e. no high heels). The interior is extremely spacious, too, which allowed us to roll multiple shirts and sweaters in. And so nothing goes missing, there is a laptop sleeve, a water bottle cinched pocket, and two larger slip pockets for passports, wallets, and phones. All in all, we could organize, bring a ton of items, and still look chic — a true win-win situation.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-31 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Dimensions: </strong>10” L x 18” H | <strong>Materials: </strong>Leather | <strong>Colors:&nbsp;</strong>1</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-carry-on-muji-adjustable-handle-hard-shell-suitcase></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Carry-on</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Muji Adjustable Handle Hard Shell Suitcase</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Muji Adjustable Handle Hard Shell Suitcase" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/BXiqIZ3vLJkYR1XAcFWXqoDPe1A=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/muji--adjustable-handle-hard-shell-suitcase--39e0ee095e9f4d56b743696f877ab905.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Muji&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>The wheels run very smoothly and can be locked into place when not in use.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love: </strong>It doesn’t come with any additional pouches or perks.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-35 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">We didn’t know how smooth wheels could roll until pushing this carry-on suitcase through rough pebbled European streets. No matter how heavy the case was packed, it would still roll as though it only carried a feather. Muji has an extensive travel collection which we all adore, but this simple yet elegant suitcase has to take the cake. We could easily fit enough items for a week-long getaway. The two interior compartments are divided by a zippered mesh flap, where we keep miscellaneous items like notebooks. When the suitcase is closed, we could clip the zipper handles into its designated clasp on the side and lock it with a key, giving it an extra layer of anti-theft protection. And the best part? We could lock the wheels from rolling, allowing us to leave it standing on a moving train without it skedaddling down the aisle. While many modern suitcases come with additional pouches or even charging pods, this suitcase does not.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-36 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Dimensions: </strong>14.6” L x 9.4” W x 21.3” H | <strong>Materials: </strong>Recycled polycarbonate, recycled polyester, polyester<strong> </strong>|<strong> Colors:&nbsp;</strong>5</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-for-organizing-paravel-aviator-carry-on></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best for Organizing</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Paravel Aviator Carry-On</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Paravel Aviator Carry-On" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/v0atBNCsvZg0OBX-OhLvFubMSts=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/paraval-aviator-carry-on-bc1b934ed3054e4385216a924a3269a2.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Paravel</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>It comes with a compression board that helps to save space.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love: </strong>It’s slightly heavier than your average carry-on suitcase.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-39 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Anyone looking to book a luxurious trip should have an equally luxurious suitcase to match. Owning the Paravel Aviator Carry-On felt like a beautiful travel experience in itself. Dare we say we actually enjoyed packing for once? That’s because it comes with multiple interior pockets, a separate laundry bag, and an interior compression board, which helps to press down clothing and allow for more space. And <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">packing cubes </a>made separating shoes from clothes a breeze. All of the details are beautifully designed, with vegan leather finishes and buttery smooth zippers — which by the way, could be locked and sealed for anti-theft.

We did notice that at 8.2 pounds the suitcase is a little heavier than some of the others we tested. Considering it’s a carry-on, it plays less of a role at TSA. But if you’re trying to slim down your luggage weight as much as possible perhaps this is not the one for you.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-41 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Dimensions: </strong>13.7” L x 9” W x 21.7” H | <strong>Materials: </strong>Recycled polycarbonate, recycled aluminum handles, recycled zippers, vegan leather | <strong>Colors:&nbsp;</strong>5</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-weekender-calpak-hue-laptop-duffel></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Weekender</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Calpak Hue Laptop Duffel</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Calpak Hue Laptop Duffel" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/sDceRieVEVSfkEuXCYuAa9hTS_I=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/calpak-hue-laptop-duffel-80149b9f471b4222abfc7027263fdc40.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Nordstrom</p></span><p>Our Ratings</p><ul class=product-record__attribute-ratings-list><li class=rating-list-item><p>Capacity</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4.5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Design</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Portability</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Durability</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Value</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li></ul><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>A padded laptop sleeve saves us from needing to bring an extra bag for our laptop.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love: </strong>We wish there were a few more color options.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-44 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Duffel bags are a favorite go-to for little weekend getaways, and this option from Calpak offered far more than just a big empty space for clothes. Most notably, a padded laptop sleeve protected our laptop during transportation. A discreet phone slit made answering phone calls easy, and various pockets in and around the bag offered more ways to organize our valuables. A little slot fit for suitcase handles allowed us to keep everything together and our hands free. When we’re not traveling, the bag doubles as a great gym bag, giving us more chances to use it in everyday life. We would have loved a few more color options, like navy and white, but the four currently available will suit most tastes.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-45 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Dimensions: </strong>18” L x 9.5” W x 10” H | <strong>Materials: </strong>Polyester, polyurethane | <strong>Colors:&nbsp;</strong>4</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-for-business-away-the-everywhere-bag></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best for Business</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Away The Everywhere Bag</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Away The Everywhere Bag" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/Qr9LHz2cZbK10ztcSG4Da8DaDxU=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/everywhere-bag-33694c9258e84781921046d76257669d.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Away</p></span><p>Our Ratings</p><ul class=product-record__attribute-ratings-list><li class=rating-list-item><p>Capacity</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Organization</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Design</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Portability</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>3.5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Value</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li></ul><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>Its sleek appeal makes it easy to go straight from the airport to a meeting.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love: </strong>We wish it were a tiny bit bigger to fit an extra outfit.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-48 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Going somewhere for business? This bag from Away looks like a large briefcase and functions partly as one, too. With a separate compartment for laptops, pouches for notebooks and pens, a zippered section for wallets and passports, and a mesh pocket for a water bottle, the Everywhere bag has been a sleek way to organize all our business essentials. The center compartment is large enough to pack enough clothes for a two-day trip, we found, but not more. With how sleek and minimalist the bag looks, we could easily carry it from the plane to the meeting without stopping by a hotel. After accidentally spilling some water onto the bag while being served by a flight attendant, we were happy to find the exterior was completely water-resistant.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-49 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Dimensions: </strong>16.3” L x 7.3” W x 10.2” H | <strong>Materials: </strong>Nylon, leather | <strong>Colors:&nbsp;</strong>5</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-duffel-ll-bean-adventure-rolling-duffle></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Duffel</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>L.L.

Bean has been a trusted destination for all things adventure, so it only made sense to test one of their duffel bags. While the main zip didn’t open all too wide, the interior it opens up to is deceptively large. It felt as though we could keep placing items in it and it would magically expand internally. On top of being able to hold it using the top handles, it could also be rolled like a regular suitcase. It surely made whizzing from point A to B much lighter. Thankfully, the wheels were incredibly smooth.

We even threw the suitcases on the floor to see if anything would break, snap, or scratch.

It’s actually up to individual airlines to determine carry-on and checked luggage size requirements, as opposed to TSA. This means that different restrictions may apply from flight to flight (though a commonly accepted maximum carry-on size is 22 x 14 x 9 inches).

A bag that expands isn’t a bad idea either, just in case you come home with souvenirs.
