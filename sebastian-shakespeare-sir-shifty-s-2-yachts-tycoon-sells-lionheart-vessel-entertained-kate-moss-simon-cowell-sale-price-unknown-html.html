Sir Philip declines to comment, but the new owners are believed to be from the UK and the home port of the vessel, which sails under a British ensign, is Douglas on the Isle of Man.</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>Its new owners use the superyacht privately and are also chartering it to plutocrats for up to £563,000 a week in high season. Marketing literature boasts of the boat’s ‘show-stopping’ pool area, ‘lavish cinema’ and ‘several options for dining’.</span></p><h2>RELATED ARTICLES</h2><ul class="rotator-pages link-xocc"><li class=rotator-prev><a href=# data-page=prev>Previous</a></li><li><a href=# data-page=1>1</a></li><li><a href=# data-page=2>2</a></li><li class=rotator-next><a href=# data-page=next>Next</a></li></ul><ul class="rotator-panels link-bogr1 linkro-ccox"><li><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2016/08/17/20/375699E300000578-0-image-m-47_1471461682866.jpg width=62 height=60 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto> <span>‘That's going in the f****** sea’: Sir 'Shifty' Philip Green...</span></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2016/08/16/20/13454D5B00000514-0-image-a-11_1471374794452.jpg width=62 height=60 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto> <span>Everything MUST go: Closing date for BHS stores is postponed...</span></a></li><li><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2016/08/17/01/373E381F00000578-0-image-m-35_1471394211845.jpg width=62 height=60 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto> <span>EPHRAIM HARDCASTLE: Team GB medal rush in Rio has given the...</span></a></li></ul><h2>Share this article</h2><span class=wai>Share</span><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>The tycoon was dubbed ‘Philip Greed’ after he and his family banked more than £400 million in dividends from BHS during his 15 years at the helm, before selling the High Street chain for £1 in 2015 to serial bankrupt Dominic Chappell.</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>If Green, who was accused of ‘cowboy capitalism’, needs to raise any more cash to support the 20,000 members of the BHS pension scheme, he could always sell his two other yachts.&nbsp;</span></p><img id=i-2be515cb64248837 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2016/08/18/01/034352C9000003E8-3746264-image-a-18_1471481854884.jpg height=423 width=634 alt="Sir Shifty has flogged the superyacht Lionheart (pictured) on which he used to entertain model Kate Moss and pop mogul Simon Cowell" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p class=imageCaption>Sir Shifty has flogged the superyacht Lionheart (pictured) on which he used to entertain model Kate Moss and pop mogul Simon Cowell</p><img id=i-3f8553393092d26b src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2016/08/18/01/3756804700000578-3746264-image-a-19_1471481864898.jpg height=423 width=634 alt="The three-storey vessel, which sleeps up to 12 people and has a crew of 18, has now been registered under the name Lioness V" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p class=imageCaption>The three-storey vessel, which sleeps up to 12 people and has a crew of 18, has now been registered under the name Lioness V</p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>He and his Monte Carlo-based wife, Tina, took delivery of the newest just last month.
