I've bought M&S clogs several years running for my two and they do look quite worn out by the end of the summer, but it's never been an issue since they had outgrown them by next year anyway."</p><h2>Decathalon Elasticated Aqua Shoes 120 for Kids</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/c6e1b0db2dc0-aqua-shoes-decathlon-z.jpg> <a href=# class="buttonWidgetButton_b1lxbopb buttonClass_by57jsl -primary" rel="sponsored nofollow"><p>£12.99 AT DECATHALON</p></a><p id=etCd03xfdAYG data-wc=9><strong>Available sizes:&nbsp;</strong>Children’s size 9.5 to adult's size 2.5</p><p id=e8ERXq71oFij data-wc=45>These elasticated Aquashoes are designed to be worn while swimming in the sea and exploring rocks on the shore – they remove the danger of little ones cutting their feet on sharp stones.

We've had these shoes in the past for the kids to go wading in the sea with when there were pebbles and rocks on the sea bed that could have hurt their feet. They're easy to get on and off and dry really quickly."</p><h2>Crocs Unisex Classic Kids' Clogs</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/571af00280a0-crocs-z.jpg> <a href=# class="buttonWidgetButton_b1lxbopb buttonClass_by57jsl -primary" rel="sponsored nofollow"><p>FROM £12 AT AMAZON</p></a><p id=e7B7wNtrkXjv data-wc=9><strong>Available sizes:</strong> Children’s size 2 to adult size 10</p><p id=ejwBpewi3TbN data-wc=71>Crocs are the original beach shoe that spawned all the copies. The advantage of shelling out for the real deal is they tend to last longer and wear much better than other models. They’re a bit more pricey, but you can find bargains on Amazon, like the ones above. They’re available in a rainbow of colours, but some colours are more expensive than others, so check before you add to basket!</p><p id=eASl8nnkwgmu data-wc=76><strong>Editor's note:</strong> “Crocs are the shoes we just keep coming back to year after year. Everyone in the family owns a pair, even the adults! I tend to size up with Crocs in an attempt to get them to last a couple of years - they're so durable that they will last. When compared to 'own brand' imitations at the end of the summer, you can see the difference - the Crocs hold up much better."</p><p id=eQvoLzR-sd_w data-wc=37>There's also currently a sale on at the Crocs online store, so you can snap up some bargains at up to 50% off.
