Like a journey that is repeated over and over again,” explains the house’s director of high-jewellery creation, Jacqueline Karachi. Cue dazzling necklaces adorned in fruity-looking combinations of carved gemstones, pieces that resemble sea urchins or prowling panthers and, as a particular highlight, a spectacular suite of jewels named 'Yfalos' that owes its bold hues to a tropical coral reef.</p><h2 class="css-kr21rx eutn2uj7">Dior</h2><img alt="dior necklace" data-cy=slide-image-2 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/dior-jewellery-65b3c677cb8fc.jpg title="Dior necklace" width=2000 height=2000 decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Couture detailing was the focus at Dior, where Victoire de Castellane honoured the intricate embroidery that featured in many of Christian Dior’s couture gowns with her new collection, ‘Délicat’. For one suite, fine lines of diamonds have been set into gold to resemble the neat stitches of Dior’s talented ‘petite mains’, who craft the clothing with precision and finesse, while other earrings, necklaces and cuffs feature colourful arrangements of rubies, sapphires, rubellites and tanzanites that recall floral appliqué. In a feat of supreme craftsmanship, rose gold has even been hand-carved into strips of lacy ‘ribbon’, swatches of which would have no doubt filled Monsieur Dior’s atelier in the 1940s and '50s.</p><h2 class="css-kr21rx eutn2uj7">Boucheron</h2><img alt="boucheron brooch" data-cy=slide-image-3 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/boucheron-noeud-chest-brooch-version-of-the-necklace-set-with-a-4-05-ct-pear-cut-diamond-and-rock-crystal-paved-with-diamonds-in-white-gold-65b5297f1f89e.png title="Boucheron brooch" width=1000 height=1000 decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">In the hands of Boucheron’s creative director, Claire Choisne, humble rock crystal – a signature material at the Maison for decades – can be elevated into all manner of precious jewels. This season it has been frosted, sliced and sculpted to resemble military braids, bows and frogging for a new collection entitled ‘The Power of Couture’. Here, it provides a luminous contrast to icy white diamonds, as seen in one ingenious necklace which resembles a collar of gleaming medals (which took over 2,000 hours to construct), or a pair of pendant earrings that look like neat lines of engraved buttons. Transformability is also a big feature of the collection, with detachable elements in almost every piece – think collars that change into tiaras, necklace motifs that become brooches, and shoulder adornments that can be worn on your waist or in your hair.</p><p>Advertisement - Continue Reading Below</p><h2 class="css-kr21rx eutn2uj7">De Beers</h2><img alt="de beers forces of nature" data-cy=slide-image-4 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/de-beers-forces-of-nature-buffalo-crown-ring-and-zebra-jacket-ring-and-elephant-crown-ring-and-giraffe-crown-ring-original-46765-65b52a8bee60d.jpg title="De Beers Forces of Nature,Buffalo Crown Ring and Zebra Jacket Ring and Elephant Crown Ring and Giraffe Crown Ring" width=7100 height=7100 decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The new ‘Forces of Nature’ high-jewellery line is a sparkling tribute to southern Africa, an important region in De Beers’ diamond production. Eight eye-catching rings, all with an important diamond at their heart, have been crafted to resemble animals native to the area. The Lion Jacket ring sees a 5.09-carat trilliant-cut diamond surrounded by a ‘mane’ of beaded yellow gold, which can be taken off if you’d rather wear the central diamond as a solitaire. Meanwhile, the Zebra Jacket ring is a chunky cocktail piece with a stunning 3.09 carat Asscher-cut diamond embraced by a (removable) pair of prancing zebras with black lacquer and white diamond bodies. If a playful and spirited approach to nature is key to these jewels, we can expect even greater flights of fancy when the rest of the collection is revealed this summer.</p><h2 class="css-kr21rx eutn2uj7">Chaumet</h2><img alt="chaumet jewellery" data-cy=slide-image-5 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/ballet-brooch-full-diamond-085469-rvb-65b3c74fb9d3d.jpg title="Chaumet jewellery" width=2000 height=2000 decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">As the official jeweller to the French Empress Joséphine, the house of Nitot (which later evolved into Chaumet) produced exquisite jewels bearing many of her favourite motifs, including birds. The Empress was a renowned animal collector and amassed a large menagerie of feathered creatures – such as rare swans, parrots and Australian emus – at her country home, Malmaison. Nearly three centuries later, the storied Parisian jeweller has revisited this important theme in ‘Un Air de Chaumet’. Blending innovative silhouettes (ear cuffs, multi-purpose hair pins and asymmetric earrings) with the traditional symbol for happiness, a flock of swallows, the collection radiates energy, lightness and joy, which seems apt for our increasingly uncertain times.</p><h2 class="css-kr21rx eutn2uj7">David Morris</h2><img alt=chart data-cy=slide-image-6 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/09-04-1127-david-morris-juno-earrings-1-65b3c7f739b2a.jpg title=chart width=2000 height=2000 decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">CEO and creative director Jeremy Morris has combined two of his greatest fascinations – extraordinary gemstones and the mesmerising beauty of the Aurora Borealis – into a spectacular new collection named 'Skye' (also the name of his youngest daughter). Precious green, blue and pink-hued gems have been used throughout to immortalise the ethereal colours of the Northern Lights, as in the weighty ‘Starburst’ bangle that shimmers with over 58 carats of sapphires and more than 52 carats of bright Paraiba tourmalines; or the ‘Horizon’ cocktail ring, which glows with a peachy-pink padparadscha sapphire set atop rows of pink diamonds (a house favourite since the 1960s). The collection also highlights the use of rose-cut brilliants, a shape which Jeremy Morris revived more than 20 years ago, as used in the Asteria white diamond necklace, which fuses their soft, romantic shape with a graphic silhouette to create dynamism and drama.</p><p>Advertisement - Continue Reading Below</p><h2 class="css-kr21rx eutn2uj7">Graff</h2><img alt=chart data-cy=slide-image-7 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/graff-fancy-intense-25-02-and-25-06-carat-pear-shape-yellow-diamond-earrings-with-round-and-pave-white-diamonds-set-in-yellow-gold-and-white-gold-total-59-63cts-ge65182-65b3c8395c4ce.jpg title="Graff " width=3004 height=3003 decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">As ever, Graff has done away with excess metal, distracting motifs and overbearing settings and let its gemstones do all the talking – after all, the house is responsible for selling some of the rarest stones in the world, so why detract from their glory? Flawless yellow diamonds, dazzling Columbian emeralds, deep red Mozambican rubies and velvety, untreated sapphires from Sri Lanka take centre stage in its latest collection, all enhanced with white diamonds for flashes of exceptional brilliance. The house also proves that sometimes, size really does matter – as testified by an enormous 118-carat cushion cut sapphire set in a dramatic diamond bangle and a weighty 17.29 emerald in a pared-back platinum ring.</p><h2 class="css-kr21rx eutn2uj7">Louis Vuitton</h2><img alt="a black and white photo of a ring with a diamond in the middle" data-cy=slide-image-8 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/louis-vuitton-high-jewellery-deep-time-ii-still-life-necklace-bones-65b3c6cf8b080.jpg title="Louis Vuitton " width=2000 height=2000 decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The dawn of time was again the theme at Louis Vuitton, with 50 new one-of-a-kind designs added to the house’s existing 'Deep Time' high-jewellery collection. “At Louis Vuitton we are as ever adventurers, travelling to extraordinary, unexpected places,” says creative director Francesca Amfitheatrof of her eternal inspiration. The ancient supercontinents of Gondwana and Laurasia have given rise, both literally and imaginatively, to a parure featuring a unique seven-row necklace of yellow and pink gold contrasted with cool platinum and set with yellow diamonds. Elsewhere, Amfitheatrof has interpreted the structure of primordial DNA into a geometric suite bristling with white gold ‘nails’, and soft, globular bodies of early fungi into to a stunning multi-stranded necklace strewn with pink and purple spinels and dotted with diamond ‘mushroom caps’. Of course, the house’s link to modern travel is never far away – with signature flower-cut gemstones, diamond ropes and tassels used throughout the collection, recalling its iconic travel luggage.</p><p><h6 class="css-1qmam5g e1a8voem2"><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p0"></span><span class="css-0 e1a8voem1">Watch Next</span><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p1"></span></h6><h6 class="css-4iho3 e1a8voem0">&nbsp;</h6></p><img data-dynamic-svg=true src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.harpersbazaar.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/play.db7c035.svg?primary=%2523ffffff" data-testid=dynamic-svg-base height=24 width=24 alt="Play Icon" role=img title=Play style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><img alt="preview for Featured Videos from Harpers Bazaar UK" title="Video player poster image" width=2000 height=1000 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/vidthumb/images/maxresdefault-1-63fe26bb0578b.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p>Advertisement - Continue Reading Below</p><p>Advertisement - Continue Reading Below</p><p>Advertisement - Continue Reading Below</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qa3RqZyrq5KWx6Kt0WeaqKVfqrhwssCsn6KnnmS3psPEpaOeqqlixKLAwqGcrGeXaIBzfZFub2lnk6TCtcHRnmShoZedequx1p6jpZ2irnw%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 DashJ - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
