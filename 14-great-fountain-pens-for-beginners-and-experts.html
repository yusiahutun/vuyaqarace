We've organized our list of fave fountain pens by price to help you narrow things down and choose the best one for you.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=things-to-consider-before-you-choose-a-fountain-pen>Things to Consider Before You Choose a Fountain Pen</h2><p>If you're new to fountain pens, there are a few things you need to know before you can decide which one to buy. Here are a few things to consider:</p><ul><li><strong>Nib:&nbsp;</strong>The end of the pen where the ink comes out is the nib. They're typically available in quite a few sizes, including 1.1 mm, extra-fine, fine, medium, or broad. Some people might prefer the ultra-precision of an extra-fine nib, while others appreciate the easier to use wider nibs. Think about your writing style, and which size would work the best for you.</li><li><strong>Refilling mechanism: </strong>You refill the ink in a fountain pen, and there are quite a few different mechanisms for doing so. All the pens on our list have either piston-filler (the kind you dip into an ink jar to refill) or cartridge (the kind with replaceable ink cartridges) mechanisms. Note that you can use an ink-converter on a cartridge pen so you can also dip it in jarred ink, but you usually have to buy that separately. We note on the lists below which pens include a converter or recommend a specific model for those to which this applies.</li><li><b>Material:&nbsp;</b>This largely depends on your preference. Some people want something sleek and smooth, while others might prefer something that offers a better grip. Either way, your pen should be comfortable for you to use and made of a material that's worth the price you pay for it.</li></ul><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=the-best-fountain-pens-under-25>The Best Fountain Pens Under $25</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/3ba9ffd7.png> <a href=#>Billion Photos/Shutterstock</a><p>If you've never used a fountain pen before or don't want to spend a lot on one, none of these will break the bank:</p><ul><li><a href=# class="norewrite noskim" rel="sponsored nofollow">Kaweco Perkeo Fountain Pen:</a> This entry-level fountain pen looks nice and is available in four color combinations (blue and white, gray and yellow, pink and gray, or pink and black).

It's also available in a ton of colors.</li></ul><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Fountain pens require a bit more of an investment than your standard ballpoint---and that doesn't apply just to the price. You have to be gentle with the nibs and refill the ink. However, if you write a lot, the benefits of a good fountain pen will far outweigh its cost.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbvWraagnZWge6S7zGhqam1ianxygIygqZ6ZpGKzsMHNrZiipl2lsq%2B%2FjJ%2Bmq2WSmrSqus2eqaxlkaOxbrHXqZyrrKNk</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 DashJ - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
