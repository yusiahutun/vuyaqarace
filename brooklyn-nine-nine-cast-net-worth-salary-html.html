According to&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Celebrity Net Worth</a>, he’s worth an estimated $5 million. His salary is also unreported.</p><h2><strong>Andre Braugher</strong></h2><figure class="wp-block-embed-instagram wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram" id=emb-5></figure><p id=par-9_44>Actor Andre Braugher portrays Raymond Holt, the high-brow chief of the department.

Samberg rose to prominence with his comedy trio The Lonely Island on&nbsp;Saturday Night Live. He’s also known for such films as&nbsp;Popstar: Never Stop Never Stopping, and for his work as a writer and producer.</p><p id=par-12_37>Speaking of, Samberg’s work behind-the-camera puts his salary a bit higher than that of his castmates.&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Celebrity Net Worth</a>&nbsp;estimates that he makes $125,000 per episode. His net worth is around $20 million, up from $16 million in 2018.</p><h2><strong>Terry Crews</strong></h2><figure class="wp-block-embed-instagram wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram" id=emb-7></figure><p id=par-13_42>Finally, actor Terry Crews portrays Terry Jeffords, a lieutenant who loves his family, working out, and yogurt. Crews was a football player before becoming an actor, gaining notoriety for films like&nbsp;White Chicks&nbsp;and&nbsp;Idiocracy, along with series such as&nbsp;Everybody Hates Chris&nbsp;and&nbsp;Are We There Yet?</p><p id=par-14_40>Today, Crews is something of an action hero, starring&nbsp;Deadpool 2&nbsp;and&nbsp;The Expendables&nbsp;franchise.
