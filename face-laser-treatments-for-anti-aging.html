As it turns out, there's a ton of information out there on the subject matter. So to help guide me through the laser thicket, I tapped Kathryn Clayton, an Aesthetic Nurse Practitioner at <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2>SkinSpirit</a>. Not only did she share the four most common types of facial laser treatments but also the benefits and potential side effects of each. Each type of laser addresses certain skincare concerns, and the laser that is right for you might not be the one that's right for me. So from least powerful to most powerful laser, here is a comprehensive guide to how to choose the best laser for you.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_5-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Keep reading for four popular facial laser treatments.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-1-ipl-and-bbl-560-or-590-nanometers-in-wavelength></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_7-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>1. IPL and BBL (560 or 590 nanometers in wavelength)</span></h2><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_8-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>What It Is</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_9-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">IPL (Intense Pulsed Light) and BBL (Broad Band Light) are lower-wavelength lasers that are more gentle on the skin as compared to some other laser treatments, explains Clayton. "If you've been taking care of your skin and you want to tiptoe into lasers, IPL would be a good place to start." And while they don't require any downtime, because they are so gentle you will generally need to do a series of treatments with these lasers to see results, she adds.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_11-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>What It Treats</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_12-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">According to Clayton, IPL and BBL lasers are a good option to start out with if you're only dealing with pigmentation or a redness issue. "They're good for sun damage, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>brown spots</a>, capillaries around the nose and cheeks." You may also want to consider these facial laser treatments if you have <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>rosacea</a>.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_14-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Possible Side Effects</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_15-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Although these treatments can address common skin concerns, people with darker skin should be careful with IPL and BBL, stresses Clayton. "Melanin really loves this wavelength," she says. "If you have someone with darker skin, you can burn them and hyperpigment them."</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-2-resurfix-and-fraxel-1565-nanometers-in-wavelength></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_19-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>2. Resurfix and Fraxel (1565 nanometers in wavelength)</span></h2><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_20-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>What It Is</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_21-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Resurfix and Fraxel treatments work by using microscopic laser columns to target the dermis and&nbsp;stimulate collagen production. Since these lasers are above 900 nanometers, they target water (instead of melanin) — which means they're able to address textural changes in the skin and are generally safer for people with darker skin tones. And because they're under 2000 nanometers, they don't ablate the surface of the skin, adds Clayton. Translation: little to no downtime.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_23-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>What It Treats</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_24-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">These facial laser treatments help to improve skin's texture, reducing the appearance of <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>fine lines and wrinkles</a>, as well as scars. They also work to better tone, addressing pigmentation and sun damage.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_26-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Pro tip: "You can do an IPL and then do a Resurfix on top of it, at the same appointment," Clayton explains. "That's a good combination because it targets the reds and browns as well as any mild textural issues."</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_30-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Possible Side Effects</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_31-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Although Resurfix and Fraxel tend to be better than other types of lasers for darker skin tones, Clayton says to proceed with caution. "You still have to be careful not to over-treat anyone. I would go to somebody who specializes in treating darker skin," she advises.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_33-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>VIDEO: How to Treat Under-Eye Wrinkles, According to Skincare Experts</strong></p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-3-halo-2940-nanometers-in-wavelength></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_37-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>3. Halo (2940 nanometers in wavelength)</span></h2><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_38-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>What It Is</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_39-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Halo is both an ablative and non-ablative laser treatment that can be used on all skin types, including darker skin tones because it targets water instead of melanin. However, Clayton adds that darker skin tones will sometimes need to be pre-treated with <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>hydroquinone</a>. "If you're just starting out [with facial laser treatments], I would go with a Halo laser to get a little freshened up, then switch to IPL and Resurfix to maintain," she shares.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_41-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>What It Treats</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_42-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"If you have deep wrinkles and really stubborn inset lines, you're going to need skin tightening stuff too — so we have to up the ante a little bit more," Clayton explains. This means treating the skin with the Halo laser. This facial treatment also combats acne scars.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_44-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Possible Side Effects</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_45-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">But the additional power of a Halo also has some downsides. Because it's ablative, "you're going to get more of that oozy, weepy feel" on your skin, comments Clayton. Additionally, she cautions against people with melasma using most lasers, but especially ablative ones. "Melasma hates the heat, and you can flare it up," she says. "I tend to use more <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>chemical peels</a> with melasma."</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-4-co2-10000-nanometers-in-wavelength></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_49-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>4.

It's an ablative laser treatment that uses CO2 to improve skin's tone and texture by boosting collagen production. You'll need conscious sedation or laughing gas for the procedure. Plus, this laser requires the most downtime (around two weeks), and you can really only do it once every two to five years.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_53-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>What It Treats</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_54-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Clayton recommends this laser for patients who have aggressive elastosis (a condition in which the skin loses elasticity, usually due to sun exposure) and wrinkles.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_56-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Possible Side Effects</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_57-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Patients with rosacea will sometimes see a flare-up after getting a CO2 treatment. Additionally, Clayton says people with darker skin tones need to be extremely careful when getting a CO2 laser treatment. "If you go too aggressive you can cause scarring and <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>hyperpigmentation</a>, and you can't fix that," she cautions.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-faqs-399daaaa-a0f4-452c-88df-ec8d8d1db399></span><h2 class=mntl-sc-block-universal-faq__title>Frequently Asked Questions</h2><ul id=mntl-sc-block-universal-faq__content_1-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block-universal-faq__content mntl-accordion js-accordion" readability=44.574944071588><li class="accordion__item js-accordion-item is-active" data-ordinal=1 readability=-1><p><span class=accordion__title>Do facial laser treatments hurt?</span></p><p>They may be uncomfortable, but pain tolerance varies according to the individual.
