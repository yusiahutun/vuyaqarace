He hoped they would then dump that power into him, before he killed himself -- and the dark magic -- for good with a white oak stake.</p><p>While Klaus' fate will remain unknown until next week's series finale, we do know that Hope will survive, as she's starring in her own spinoff, "Legacies," premiering this fall. Alaric and twins Lizzie and Josie will also star, while Caroline's involvement remains TBD.</p><p>Though the Saltzman twins helped out Hope -- in exchange for the right to wear shorter skirts to school, of course -- tonight, both Davis and Russell teased some animosity between the three girls on "Legacies" when TooFab spoke with them at <strong><a href=#>Comic-Con</a></strong> over the weekend.</p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/38/16by9/2018/07/25/38bfb012dd3c5e62bd8420f6f98b042a_md.jpg width=825 height=464 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p>Calling them "defiant" teens in the spinoff, he said Ric is constantly "ducking, bobbing, weaving when they get angry." He said the young women are also "jealous of Hope because Alaric has to tend to Hope and Hope has a lot of special demands. There's this struggle for Alaric's attention, while keeping the school in order and everything hidden, he's got a lot on his place to manage."</p><p>"With Alaric, it's kind of fun actually," Russell said of Hope's relationship with the headmaster. "They have this fun, sassy banter, they have fun personalities. I really like that, it's almost like some weird uncle, father figure that they have. With Lizzie and Josie, it's not so much friendly. They're definitely like polar opposites and they haven't been friends, let's just say that."</p><p>Creator Julie Plec also added that "their dislike of Hope Mikaelson is epic."</p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/bb/16by9/2018/07/25/bbd12ce983e159e1b60a38c6a7c2966e_md.jpg width=825 height=464 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p>If Klaus doesn't end up sacrificing himself, there's a pretty good chance he'll rekindle his romance with Caroline, as the two almost kissed during Wednesday's episode. Things aren't always as simple for Ric and his love life.</p><p>"So complicated. It's a thing. We gotta get him back on Tinder," said Davis. "Joking aside, I would love to see him fall in love. I would love to see him cultivate a relationship with a wonderful woman that the audience trusts. Like he trusts her, the audience trusts her. I think the trust needs to not be turned into a gimmick, like, 'I'm really something else, ha ha ha!'"</p><p>He hopes to see his character in a "stable relationship" wit someone who he "loves, protects and becomes defensive of and protective of," a woman who can make Ric "stronger" and act as a "mother figure for the kids."</p><p>He also liked the idea of Caroline re-entering the picture somewhere down the line. "Maybe you see Alaric developing feelings for this person and Caroline comes back to town and then it's like -- and I'm not saying he's falling in love with Caroline and it becomes a love triangle -- it becomes a different relationship," he explained.</p><p>"Like, what about custody?" he asked. "'This is my girlfriend, this is my baby mama.'"</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:85160eb6-d5a6-5d36-9101-53ee9dde548a data-container-ref=toofab:article:cd6f55be-e257-55ec-b4b5-11cb23c9eb9b data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=29><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/13/5by4/2018/07/22/13e2417cdc72555b8f3ad598bd13dadf_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">Everett Collection/TooFab</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">Matt Davis Says Thinks 'Legally Blonde 3' Will Be 'Great,' But Hasn't Heard From Reese (Exclusive)</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><p>The actor said to expect a whole new "realm of bad guys" on "Legacies" as well, one that moves away from the familial mythologies of the shows before it. "A whole new realm of villain that isn't rooted in the the old family line," he explained. "There was always a family coming back to Mystic Falls. This will be very autonomous."</p><p>The series finale of "The Originals" airs next Wednesday on The CW, with "Legacies" debuting on Thursday, October 25.</p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/86/16by9/2018/07/25/86836e46a411526dbce164adb8707e90_md.jpg width=825 height=464 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmisn6Szoq6NnKamZ2Jlfnl7j3Bma21foq61wIydmK%2Bho2KxorrInqOlnV2nvLSxjKusrKuVobluv8%2Bio6Vln6N6rbHGmpqinaNirq%2BwjJqjmqqZmMBuuM6vnGakmZuybq3FrZyrZZ%2Bntqi1zZqjrGWZo8Gzu44%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 DashJ - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
