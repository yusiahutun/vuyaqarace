Most of my family has clear skin, so I had to go through plenty of trial and error to figure out which products worked to eliminate dark spots. I tried home remedies, creams, and even just leaving my acne alone in hopes that I could minimize the risk of dark marks, but nothing was working. But when the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>K-beauty movement</a> took over on TikTok last year, I became obsessed with <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>achieving the glass skin look</a>. That’s when I came across <a href=# data-component=amazon data-source=affiliate data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=3 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">Beauty of Joseon’s Glow Deep Serum</a>, and it cleared up my hyperpigmentation in just a month.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The <a href=# data-component=amazon data-source=affiliate data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">Glow Deep Serum</a> is a pigmentation-fighting serum, perfect for anyone looking to even their skin tone. The water-based serum is as light as a toner, making it comfortable for all skin types. The key ingredients include 68.6 percent rice bran water and two percent arbutin. <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel=nocaes>Rice bran water</a> is rich in amino acids and minerals that help keep the skin bright and moist. <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=3 rel="nofollow nocaes">Arbutin</a>, extracted from plants like lingonberries and blueberries, helps prevent excessive melanin production and pigmentation. Additionally, the serum features <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=4 rel=nocaes>black soybean extract</a>, which protects your skin from harmful environmental factors. It's cruelty-free and made without artificial fragrances, colors, essential oils, mineral oils, or other potentially irritating ingredients.&nbsp;</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_5-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Amazon</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_6-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Shop now:</strong> $17; <a href=# data-component=amazon data-source=affiliate data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">amazon.com</a></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_8-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">I understand that the process of getting rid of dark spots is something that doesn't happen overnight, but I found that using products with common pigmentation-fighting ingredients, such as <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>lactic acids</a> and <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>vitamin C</a>, took months for me to see results. When I incorporated this <a href=# data-component=amazon data-source=affiliate data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=3 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">rice bran water-based serum</a>, I noticed stubborn spots I had for years became less visible in just two weeks. I would drop four to five drops onto my fingertips and then massage it into my face, really focusing on discolored areas. I then make sure to follow up with sunscreen. Immediately after application, I find my skin is visibly brighter, hydrated, and silky smooth. It gives you that trendy glass skin glow without being too sticky or oily.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_10-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">While I gave this brightening serum a 10 out of 10, Amazon shoppers also gave the spot corrector a perfect rating, saying it gave them "skin like glass." <a href=# data-component=amazon data-source=affiliate data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">One mother and daughter stated</a> they "patted [the serum] into their face each night for a month," and after, they "looked like glazed doughnuts." The mother said she "went to work for weeks without foundation," because of how clear her skin was after consistent use. <a href=# data-component=amazon data-source=affiliate data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">Another shopper</a> experiencing oily, sensitive, acne-prone skin found that this serum made their pores “so much smaller," "it's been keeping those breakouts at bay," and that their "sunspots are almost gone." <a href=# data-component=amazon data-source=affiliate data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=3 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">A final reviewer</a> with "hormonal breakouts" says after using the glow serum daily for two months, they noticed "brighter skin, better overall texture, reduced breakouts, and less inflammation."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_12-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">If you are looking for smooth and clear skin, <a href=# data-component=amazon data-source=affiliate data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">Beauty of Joseon's Glow Deep Serum</a> is a must-have, and it's available for $17 on Amazon.<br></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrSrbClnV6YvK57wZ6YrqypYrynecmoqp6nnmK0rbvWZpuenaBiwKa%2B1KZkmqWRr7yvedGeraKdp2KEdYSTcmpu</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 DashJ - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
