Symptoms can be mild in some, and in others more extreme causing severe disability.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>MS affects 2.3 million people worldwide - including around one million in the US, and 100,000 in the UK.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>It is more than twice as common in women as it is in men. A person is usually diagnosed in their 20s and 30s.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>The condition is more commonly diagnosed in people of European ancestry.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>The cause isn't clear. There may be genes associated with it, but it is not directly hereditary. Smoking and low vitamin D levels are also linked to MS.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Symptoms include fatigue, difficulty walking,&nbsp;vision problems, bladder problems, numbness or tingling, muscle stiffness and spasms, problems with balance and co-ordination, and&nbsp;problems with thinking, learning and planning.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>The majority of sufferers will have episodes of symptoms which go away and come back, while some have ones which get gradually worse over time.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Symptoms can be managed with medication and therapy.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>The condition shortens the average life expectancy by around five to 10 years.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pa3IpbCmmZmhe6S7ja6iaKymqLWww8GisWiZoqm2pLjEZmhrb2dtgnmDjoycpaWRYo%2BtrcirZKCqkZfAbrDIp6Weql2ovK95oKuroa2iY7W1ucs%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 DashJ - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
