Fans will also find he's capable of so much more than being a blue collar folk hero.The best <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Oliver Anthony songs</a> are dynamic and complete.

You can hear and see (if there's video) the strains of life across his face.<p>Taste of Country ranked all 16 songs Anthony has released so far. Most are cell phone recordings, but we didn't hold a lack of production quality against him. Instead, each song is rated based on strength of message, originality and overall appeal.
