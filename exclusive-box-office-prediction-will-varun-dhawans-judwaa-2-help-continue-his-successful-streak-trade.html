Directed by David Dhawan, Judwaa 2 is the sequel to the successful 1997 comedy Judwaa, starring Salman Khan, Karisma Kapoor and Rambha. This time, Salman will be seen reprising his characters Raja and Prem in a cameo appearance for Judwaa 2.&nbsp;</span></span></span></p><p><span><span><span>While the Bollywood box office scenario in 2017 has seen a tremendous fall in numbers, Varun Dhawan has the credit of eight back-to-back hits or above average movies as the actor has not delivered a flop in his career until now. With Judwaa 2, we see hope for yet another box office success, as it not only has the star value of Varun, the comedy genius of David but also the recall value of the original Judwaa.&nbsp;</span></span></span></p><p><span><span><span>Keeping this in mind, we got in touch with leading trade experts of Bollywood who gave us their opinion on how Judwaa 2 is likely to perform at the box office:&nbsp;</span></span></span> <a rel=nofollow href=# class="looms--artdiv loomsart--logodiv loomsart--logodiv-v2" onclick='trigger17LoomsEntryClick("17Looms_AP_Logo","-","-","-")'><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.pinkvilla.com/assets/images/17looms_pinkvilla_deshtop_article_entry_updated.jpg alt style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a></p><p><span><span><span><strong>Girish Johar (Film Trade Analyst):</strong> On how the box office opening and weekend collections of Judwaa 2 will be, Girish said, "The advance ticket sales and the queries for Judwaa 2 are quite outstanding and it has generated quite a lot of buzz. People are very excited to watch the film. They all believe it's a family entertainer and the Judwaa brand has done quite well. It's going to take a very good start at the box office. I expect the film to take up a minimum of INR 15 crore+ start on Day 1 which is a huge number considering the fact that it is a non-holiday. It has an extended holiday weekend with&nbsp;<span data-term=goog_1164035328 tabindex=0>October 2</span>&nbsp;being a holiday&nbsp;<span data-term=goog_1164035329 tabindex=0>on Monday</span>, and so it will have a very good and long weekend at the box office. The four-day long weekend collections should definitely be around INR 65 crore."&nbsp;</span></span></span></p><span class=f14>Advertisement</span><p><span><span><span>Will Varun's box office hits streak continue with Judwaa 2? On this, Girish revealed, "For sure. What Varun has completely achieved as a star is that he gets a great opening. People want to watch his films. In today's time, the box office audience has become very rude in my personal terminology. If they don't like a film or the teaser, they become rude and don't even go on a&nbsp;<span data-term=goog_1164035330 tabindex=0>Saturday</span>&nbsp;to watch a particular film. Today, the audience's taste has changed so much and is so drastic. Varun pulling that off in today's time definitely makes him a huge star in the making. All credit goes to him and his hard work."</span></span></span></p><p><span><span><span><strong>Atul Mohan (Trade Analyst): </strong>On how the box office opening and weekend collection were going to be, Atul said, "The advance booking is tremendous not only in India but overseas also. In terms of the opening day collections and looking at the trends, it should be INR 15 crore approx. The 4-day long weekend in numbers, we should be looking at somewhere between INR 75-80 crore."&nbsp;</span></span></span></p><p><span><span><span>Will Varun's box office hits streak continue with Judwaa 2? On this, Atul revealed, "We're talking about the numbers for the first four days, which is more than the lifetime collections not achieved by movies nowadays. It's a family, fun and entertaining film. Varun Dhawan is a craze the family audience loves him. Not only the youth but also the family audience. It should continue because recently we are seeing that movies are not doing well since the last so many weeks. The last hit was Toilet: Ek Prem Katha, which was a month and a half back. Now, all the hopes are on Judwaa 2. It will do very well."</span></span></span></p><p><span><span><span><strong>Amod Mehra (Trade Analyst): </strong>On how the box office opening and weekend collections of Judwaa 2 were going to be, Amod had a different opinion. He said, "I was very hopeful that the opening will be very big but till now the advance booking is extremely lukewarm. I'm a little disappointed with the advance booking so far. I'm only hopeful that it will pick up and by&nbsp;<span data-term=goog_1164035331 tabindex=0>Friday</span>, people will come. I had thought that the box office collections would be very big in the first four days but they haven't promoted the movie further after the first initial trailer launch, they just kept quiet. The promotion is very weak and it has resulted in the advance booking being weak. However, we're only&nbsp;<span data-term=goog_1164035332 tabindex=0>on Wednesday</span>&nbsp;now and there is still one more day to go."&nbsp;</span></span></span></p><span class=f14>Advertisement</span><p><span><span><span>Will Varun's box office hits streak continue with Judwaa 2? On this, Amod revealed, "There is no question of Judwaa 2 not recovering its money. The question is how big a hit will the movie be? I'm not even debating that the picture will not do well. I'm sure the movie will do reasonably well, that is without seeing the movie. After seeing the film, we'll come to know the exact division. At present, it will recover 100 percent."</span></span></span></p><span class=f14>Advertisement</span><p><span><span><span><strong>FINAL VERDICT:&nbsp;</strong>Looks like Varun's winning streak is going to be intact and Judwaa 2 is going to create ripples at the box office this Dussehra.</span></span></span>&nbsp;</p><p><span><span><span>Are you excited to watch Judwaa 2?
