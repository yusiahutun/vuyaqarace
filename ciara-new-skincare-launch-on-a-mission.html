So if you've been chasing Ciara's signature glow since "Goodies," we have great news: Her debut skincare brand, <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.oamskin.com/password data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="OAM (On a Mission)" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">OAM (On a Mission)</a>, is out now.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=1 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Though celebrities might not always be just like us, Ciara's experience navigating beauty is relatable and exactly the thing that inspired her line. "When I'd go into stores, I didn't know where to start and stop. It was so overwhelming, and I thought, There has to be a simpler way to understand the steps I need to care for my skin," Ciara tells BAZAAR.com.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=2 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">OAM is launching with a skin radiance system, a clinical set of five products designed to help brighten all skin tones: a foaming cleanser ($28), brightening pads ($28), a 20 percent vitamin C serum ($62), an eye cream ($35), and a moisturizer ($43). "All of us are looking for that radiance, that glow up," she says. "These products give you just that." The singer's favorites? She says it was a tough choice, but it comes down to the hydrating cleanser and the vitamin C serum (which she loves, because it doesn't irritate her sensitive skin).</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=5 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">"This all goes back to that simple process for womenâ€”for everyone," she says. "It's like looking at your body like a car. You have to put the best oil into your car, and this relates especially to our skin. So I wanted to make sure I factored in all of the skin's key needs. To further simplify the process, OAM has included a numbering system (on every bottle and box top) to help you properly layer each of the products during your routine.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=6 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The hero ingredient in all five of the products is the brand's Tri-C Pro-Peptide Complex. This blend of peptides and three forms of vitamin C allows for a high concentration without the irritation. "The vitamin C is game-changing. It helps to correct, protect, and prevent," she says. Additionally, the brightening serum features a controlled system that aims to release the different forms of vitamin C into the skin at different rates in a way that's unique to each person's skin.</p><img alt="oam skincare by ciara" title="oam skincare by ciara" width=1000 height=552 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/oam-ciara-dropper-1000x552-1663201761.jpeg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">OAM Skin</span></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=8 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Another key factor that came up in development was that Ciara wanted the line to work for all skin tones, which is why the entire lineup was clinically tested on the full range of the Fitzpatrick scale (the classification system for skin colors). "If we're going to be about it, we're going to be about it," she says. "It was only right that we made sure all of these products are for all skin types and skin tones. It's something we take pride in, and I believe it's one of the things that sets us apart."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=9 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">And when Ciara says everyone, she means everyone. Even her husband, Russell Wilson, got in on the action. "I have tested it on him," she says. "And he's actually enjoyed it."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=10 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">On a Mission skincare launches today and is available online at <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.oamskin.com/password data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=oamskin.com class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">oamskin.com</a>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qa3RqZyrq5KWx6Kt0WeaqKVfl7KiwdOyZqyjmaN6pK3RnmaabGFmhneAk2pmnKGRp65uusSwZKyjmaOwor7EZqOarZ6YtW67zWaYZqWZqMCqu81o</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 DashJ - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
