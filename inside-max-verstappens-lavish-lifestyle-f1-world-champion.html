Despite his recent salary bump, Verstappen is yet to buy property and instead rents a US$16 million flat on the eighth floor overlooking the Mediterranean. He often posts videos of his workouts on his large balcony-cum-gym and can occasionally be seen jogging around the exclusive neighbourhood.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2022/05/23/d2168aa5-6808-4e0a-a575-97b176a641a7_7390c88c.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Although far from home, Verstappen is surrounded by some familiar faces. Many of his fellow drivers – including Hamilton, Daniel Ricciardo and, most recently, Lando Norris – have properties in Monaco too. Verstappen reportedly lives in Fontvieille, the southernmost district in Monaco, which is right next to the water and, conveniently, the Monaco Heliport.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><strong data-qa=ContentSchemaRender-defaultRenderMapFunctions-Component-0 class="css-1mniedq eq9i94316">His car collection includes Ferraris and Aston Martins</strong></h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2022/05/23/02997cd5-fd91-4824-8509-9b3351f85eb7_47000465.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">It is no surprise that Verstappen apparently wants to drive the best cars both on and off the track. At just 24 years old, he’s already amassed an enviable collection of European cars worth around US$6.4 million. His first car was a gift from his parents – a yellow Renault Clio that today would cost between US$13,000 and US$24,000. His first automobile purchase of his own was a Renault R. S. 01 (US$400,000) in 2015, followed by a Porsche 911 GT3 RS (US$400,000), which he gifted himself after winning his first race in 2016. Clearly not yet used to high tabs, he told Top Gear magazine at the time that “the insurance bill is not nice”.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-Topic class="css-1wyvcgo e1b1x8aa3"></span><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-Title class="css-i31uou e1b1x8aa1">Inside Mark Zuckerberg’s billionaire lifestyle – beyond his US$400 T-shirts</span></p></a></h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2022/05/23/25a624af-ef42-4e06-9d9f-ac48387afaa0_384965fe.jpg>Since 2019, Verstappen has owned four Aston Martins. His first was a DB11 – the street-approved version of the DB10 driven by Daniel Craig’s James Bond in Spectre. Worth around US$205,000, the car has orange stitching on the seats and orange brake calipers in – possibly a nod to his home country? Next, he bought a 2018 Vantage (US$150,000) and a V12-powered DBS Superleggera (US$360,000) before splurging on the <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">Valkyrie hypercar</span></a>, an Aston Martin-Red Bull collaboration that is worth an estimated US$2.7 million.<img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2022/05/23/ca0f04db-8d17-464c-8fb7-1cc960412b7f_a18f5966.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">So far this F1 season, Red Bull’s biggest rivals are the men in red, but Verstappen is more partial to Ferraris off the track. He owns a Ferrari 488 Pista (US$331,000) that can hit 100km/h in just 2.85 seconds and the very exclusive Ferrari Monza SP2, worth a reported US$1.8 million. To top off his growing collection, he owns another rival-made car: a Mercedes-Benz C63 S AMG worth a relatively humble US$78,000.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-Topic class="css-1wyvcgo e1b1x8aa3"></span><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-Title class="css-i31uou e1b1x8aa1">Inside Elon Musk and Donald Trump’s (very) complicated relationship</span></p></a></h3><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><strong data-qa=ContentSchemaRender-defaultRenderMapFunctions-Component-0 class="css-1mniedq eq9i94316">He loves fast machines – on water, land or simulated</strong></h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2022/05/23/c5de48c9-36af-45c0-b13b-b6fab0e0c94d_29658238.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Verstappen makes the most of his seaside residence by taking his need for speed to the water during his downtime, and can sometimes be spotted enjoying the Mediterranean waters on his customised Red Bull jet ski. Watercrafts come with a price tag of anywhere between US$5,700 and US$20,000, and Verstappen’s powerful craft likely falls on the costlier end of the spectrum.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2022/05/23/2f1322be-f436-4873-9694-1d93035b1537_16269245.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Meanwhile, in his Monaco living room sits his SimRacer, which “nobody is allowed to go near”, he said during a G-Star Raw interview. High-end simulation racing gear can set an enthusiast back thousands of dollars, and even more if you’re Verstappen, who has a Playseat F1 Ultimate cockpit (US$2,800), a custom-made LM-Pro steering wheel by Precision Sim Engineering (US$1,800), Heusinkveld Ultimate pedals (US$1,100), and a Leo Bodnar SimSteering system (US$4,000). The entire set-up is estimated to cost anywhere from US$15,000 to more than US$35,000.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2022/05/23/d9576353-c812-471f-a04c-01cfeb1e5b32_5a2bca95.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Expensive and fast machines aside, Verstappen also enjoys scooting around Monaco and the paddocks. The customised Xiaomi M365 scooter has a top speed of around 26km/h and carries a much more modest price tag of between US$499 and US$599.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-Topic class="css-1wyvcgo e1b1x8aa3"></span><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-Title class="css-i31uou e1b1x8aa1">The richest Bling Empire season 2 cast members, net worths ranked</span></p></a></h3><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><strong data-qa=ContentSchemaRender-defaultRenderMapFunctions-Component-0 class="css-1mniedq eq9i94316">He owns a long-range private jet</strong></h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2022/05/23/798b2995-d05d-4d2e-84f4-f7bb41471dc2_719996e9.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The 2022 Formula One calendar is the busiest to date, with 23 Grand Prix races held across five continents between March and November. The World Champion must therefore be happy with his 2020 purchase of the Dassault Falcon 900EX aircraft from Virgin Galactic. According to reports, the private jet used to belong to no other than Richard Branson. The plane also has a customised exterior, with a matt finish and the Verstappen logo of a lion ­– the national animal of the Netherlands – on the tail fin.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2022/05/23/2086651b-89fb-4835-95ec-575968a9868d_5ac4fbf6.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Built in 2008, the plane is valued at around US$15 million, with a hefty estimated annual upkeep bill of more than US$1 million. The EX variant is the long-range plane in the Falcon 900 series (necessary for F1 racers’ transatlantic flights) and has an all-glass flight deck, bar and optional shower. Excluding the cockpit, the cabin is around 12 metres (around 40 feet) long and 1.88 metres high, and can comfortably fit 12 passengers, fewer if the adjustable seats are combined to form beds. There is therefore ample space for family and friends, and Verstappen occasionally gives his former Red Bull teammate Daniel Ricciardo lifts to and from races as they reportedly live in the same Monaco building. The plane even has its own Twitter fan page!</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><strong data-qa=ContentSchemaRender-defaultRenderMapFunctions-Component-0 class="css-1mniedq eq9i94316">He enjoys holidaying with family</strong></h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">For Verstappen, the ultimate holiday is all about “doing fun things with friends and family”, he said in his G-Star Raw interview. During the recent break between seasons, Verstappen spent time in Brazil with his girlfriend Kelly Piquet’s family before jetting off to Miami. Soon after, he was off to Austria for an exhibition at the GP Ice Race and took some time off for a helicopter ride above the Alps, which can cost around US$1,800 per hour.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><strong data-qa=ContentSchemaRender-defaultRenderMapFunctions-Component-0 class="css-1mniedq eq9i94316">He has expensive cats that appear in his Instagram posts</strong></h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2022/05/23/d3c54b6f-f680-42d5-8c9a-6ec8323ab067_5adb1d89.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">In August 2021, Verstappen welcomed new roommates: two Bengal cats that occasionally make cameo appearances on his Instagram feed. The breed is one of the most expensive in the world, with each feline costing an average of US$1,500-US$3,000. Not to mention food and vet bills.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The cats, Jimmy and Sass, are named after Monaco hotspots Jimmy’z Monte-Carlo and Sass Café, he once explained in an interview. However, when the pets crawled around his pedals during a sim race, in a video shared on YouTube, Verstappen quipped that he’d call them Lewis and Toto – after Mercedes rivals Lewis Hamilton and Toto Wolff. The nicknames have since become a running joke among fans.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-Topic class="css-1wyvcgo e1b1x8aa3"></span><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-Title class="css-i31uou e1b1x8aa1">How does Julia Roberts spend her epic US$250 million net worth?</span></p></a></h3><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><strong data-qa=ContentSchemaRender-defaultRenderMapFunctions-Component-0 class="css-1mniedq eq9i94316">His girlfriend’s dad was three-time Formula One world champ</strong></h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2022/05/23/18fa95fa-c5c2-4499-a07c-7731806988a7_d7491f3d.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">When asked during an online fan meet what his best buy was to date, the F1 champion joked, “My girlfriend.” His partner Kelly Piquet is no stranger to the racetrack or Dutch idiosyncrasies. The 33-year-old model and columnist grew up around the paddocks as her dad is three-time Formula One World Champion Nelson Piquet and her mum is a former model from the Netherlands.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2022/05/23/7c8985c9-5002-4b9c-9c84-e579c155266a_7390c88c.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Piquet has a daughter, Penelope, with Russian racing driver Daniil Kvyat, who she dated until late 2019. In October the following year, she began dating Verstappen, who announced their relationship by way of an Instagram post on January 1, 2021, saying: “Wishing you all success, love and happiness just as I found mine.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tK%2FMqWWcp51kuqKzwLOgp52jZMC1xcueZpydnJqvs7XTsmaaqqSesK2xjmxocHBoZYZwtc2soJ2dXaKuuXnVnqmsrJGlvaa60majmq6ZqLVuuMifnKysqaGybrKQZq6oqpyZeqS0wKanoqee</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 DashJ - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
