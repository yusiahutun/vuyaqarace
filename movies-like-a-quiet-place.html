Actor and director John Krasinski’s follow-up to the 2018 dystopian horror hit was expected to arrive in theaters by March 2020, but thanks to worldwide delays on Hollywood release dates, we can kiss that dream goodbye. But that still doesn’t mean that there aren’t some options available to bide our time with.</p><p>These alternatives are actually…pretty excellent as far as apocalyptic and post-apocalyptic films go. And while it can be hard to watch any story set in a harsh reality—especially <a href=#>movies like&nbsp;Contagion</a> that speak directly to our uncertain times—many viewers will find them worthwhile, and at most, comforting.</p><p>Related Stories</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/mulan-1.png> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Outlander.jpg><p>After all, there’s something determinedly worse about the circumstances in most of these films that, paradoxically, sets a frame for positive comparison. At least we can make noise without bidding the wrath of the monsters in A Quiet Place, and sit comfortably in our homes without trekking across barren deserts, like in Cargo, in search of salvation. There’s hope for us all yet.</p><p>Grab onto that while watching these five movies like&nbsp;A Quiet Place, available to stream now.</p><h2>Children of Men (2006)</h2><p><span class=embed-youtube></span></p><p>Visually arresting and politically charged, Alfonso Cuarón’s&nbsp;Children of Men follows the plight of one unlikely man on a journey to save the last known pregnant woman on Earth, where, by the year 2027, everyone else is rendered infertile.</p><p>Available to stream on <a href=# rel=nofollow>STARZ with Hulu</a>.</p><h2 class="_text_y7yck_1 _text_153t8_1" data-component=text data-alias data-alignment data-theme=product-title-lg data-transform data-truncate>Stream ‘Children of Men’ on Hulu</h2><p><span class="_text_y7yck_1 _text_153t8_1" data-component=text data-alias data-alignment data-theme=product-price data-transform data-truncate>$9.99</span></p><h2>Don’t Breathe (2016)</h2><p><span class=embed-youtube></span></p><p>A trio of thieves decide to prey on a wealthy blind man, but soon realize they picked exactly the wrong guy to mess with.
