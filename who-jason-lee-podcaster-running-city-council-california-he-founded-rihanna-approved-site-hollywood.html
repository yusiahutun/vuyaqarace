Lee was later named head of media and partnerships for Ye.Less than a year into the job though, Lee quit to focus on launching his own talk show. Per US media, two weeks after he left the position, Ye controversially wore matching White Lives Matter shirts with conservative <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">political commentator Candace Owens</span></a>. “I love Ye as a person, and I support free speech.

Lee told Complex that he wanted Ye to take responsibility for the hurt caused by his comments. “What he said about the Jewish community was almost embarrassing because we’re asking one community to politic their pain over ours,” he said. “Slavery was real, it wasn’t a choice. And the Holocaust was a real thing that caused a lot of pain.”<h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-Topic class="css-1wyvcgo e1b1x8aa3"></span><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-Title class="css-i31uou e1b1x8aa1">Who is country star Jelly Roll – and how did he meet his wife, Bunnie XO?</span></p></a></h3><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><strong data-qa=ContentSchemaRender-defaultRenderMapFunctions-Component-0 class="css-1mniedq eq9i94316">Jason Lee’s traumatic childhood</strong></h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">In an interview on VladTV, Lee opened up about his childhood, detailing how his mother battled addiction, leading to him being placed in foster care.
