As much as I love my curly hair, detangling it is a beast — and while the ordeal's gotten miles easier since welcoming <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>an electric comb</a> into my life (pry it out of my cold, dead hands), at the end of the day my shower's drain catcher wears a sizable toupee. So my eyes lit up when I happened upon the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">Rene Furterer Triphasic Strengthening Shampoo</a> that cuts down hair loss like a pro.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The French brand takes a unique approach to its hair thickening technique; instead of using something like biotin, its shampoo relies on a combination of "ATP Intensif" — also known as <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nocaes>adenosine triphosphate</a> — and castor oil, pfaffia extract, and essential oils. According to the brand, ATP helps to maintain existing hair's life and <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">kickstart the growth phase</a>, providing a two-prong block to gradual and sudden hair loss.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_5-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Hair growth products are a breeding ground for snake oil ingredients, but according to a <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nocaes>2015 study</a> of 102 people with male pattern hair loss, the group that used ATP improved 80 percent, compared to the control group's 32 percent. Hair also turned out significantly thicker in the ATP-treated group, which is great news — however, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel=nocaes>Dr. Rachel Nazarian</a>, a board-certified New York dermatologist, notes that participants were treated twice a day, so it's not quite a one-to-one comparison.</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_7-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-square figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Courtesy</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_8-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Shop now: </strong>$32; <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">renefurtererusa.com</a></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_10-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Switching gears, Dr. DiAnne Davis, a board-certified cosmetic dermatologist, has previously told InStyle that <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>castor oil is helpful for hair growth</a>, since it can increase blood flow to the hair follicles while making your hair look more glossy. "Oils can help scalp health in multiple ways, primarily as it hydrates the cuticle to avoid breaking," adds <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel=nocaes>Dr. Mona Gohara</a>, an associate clinical professor of dermatology at Yale's School of Medicine. "They also can decrease inflammation and dandruff, which can be a cause of hair loss."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_12-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">According to shoppers, the results speak for themselves. "I had immediate results. I had dreaded washing my hair because so much would end up over the drain and in my brush," writes one person. "No more. My hair is lovely and soft, and I have no scalp itch." Other people agree that the effect was stunningly fast, even thinning temples <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">thickening with the shampoo</a> and <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">matching conditioner</a>.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_14-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"I have been looking for 'the perfect shampoo' as part of my regimen to combat my aging, thinning hair," writes another fan. "Wonderfully cleansing without stripping, no harsh smell, excellent consistency. This is the shampoo I have been looking for." Others say that their hair definitely feels stronger, shinier, and more voluminous, while hair loss during washes has petered out. And as a bonus, another person says it helps them extend how long they can go between showers.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_16-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Those going through other health trials also found relief, per a reviewer who was being treated for endometriosis. "My hair started falling out by the handfuls. Within two months, I lost 40 percent of my hair," they write. "My scalp was inflamed, hair shedding like crazy, severe itching and breakage. I couldn't find a single product that helped even a little, until I found this line. I noticed today that I have new hair growth popping up at my hairline that definitely wasn't there before. I will be buying the biggest bottle."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_18-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">A different person goes so far as to dub the effects "magic," especially when used in tandem with <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">the brand's whole system</a>. Those with "incredibly fine and thin hair" say it's <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">the first shampoo</a> that doesn't make them hate their hair, and it works so well, one shopper's stuck with it for 30 years. "Saved my hair. About six months ago my hair started to really show its age, including thinning, breaking, and dullness," writes a last reviewer. "This shampoo has done wonders for me. I don't think I'll ever use another shampoo for the rest of my life!"</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_20-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Searching for more hair growth help?</span></h3><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrSrbClnV6YvK57x5qgq2eYlrazec%2Brpp2tk6nAbsDOqKOsZ6Kau6Z5xa6prZ2imr9uwNGip6GZo56wbr%2FTq5ynn6Sdsq%2B1zaBkrKCRor2wuw%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 DashJ - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
