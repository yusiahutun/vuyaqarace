And unfortunately, weeks later, police were still looking for leads and possible suspects.

He was raised by his mother, Theresa.</p><p class=align-left>Nick graduated from Chandler High School in 1998. During his high school years, he was heavily involved in sports, especially <a href=#>football</a> and wrestling.</p><p class=align-left>After finishing his studies, Nick started working as a <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">personal trainer</a>. He stuck to this role for a couple of years before diverting his interests into heating, ventilation, and air conditioning. He later bought Gilbert Air and worked hard to provide for his <a href=#>family</a>.</p><p class=align-left>Nick Cordova was a hardworking man, and many considered him a jack of all trades. Aside from his business interests, he was a family man who spent most of his free time with his wife, kids, and friends. He used to hang out with family either outside or working on one of his <a href=#>automobiles</a>.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/f7865451201674c6.png></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>The Hendricks family murder case: What happened and latest updates</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Another interesting thing about Nick, aside from his impeccable business understanding and love for this family and friends, were his hobbies. He loved riding and camping trips. So it was not strange for Nick to spend most of his weekends at Sycamore, Glamis, and Box Canyon. Also, he used most of his spare time going on camping trips to the lake and day trips out riding in the desert.</p><h2 id=427118-who-is-nick-cordova39s-wife class=table-of-contents__scroll-section>Who is Nick Cordova's wife?</h2><p class=align-left>Nick Cordova met his wife, Alysha, in 2003, and they married on October 8, 2011. According to Alysha, Nick was a <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">dedicated father</a> to his children and was involved in every part of their lives. That is why his death was so devastating. His kids will always remember him as an amazing dad and their best friend.</p><h2 id=427118-what-happened-to-nick-cordova class=table-of-contents__scroll-section>What happened to Nick Cordova?</h2><p class=align-left>Nick Cordova from Arizona was <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">found dead</a> at about 5:30 pm on May 27, 2020, inside Gilbert Air, Heating and Cooling at 511 W. Guadalupe Road. However, the police did not release the information to the public until recently, when they required help identifying the primary suspects.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/ec0b422b381d0076.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Candy Jane Tucker: What you may not know about Steve-O's ex-wife</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Nick's wife, Alysha Cordova, was home with their children, who were video chatting with their father. One of the children noticed something was wrong with their father when they started hearing of a scuffle but couldn't see anything.</p><p class=align-left>Alysha called the police and hurried to the scene. However, upon arriving at Nick Cordova’s <a href=#>business</a> premises, she learned that he was already dead.</p><h2 id=427118-little-information-available-about-the-murder class=table-of-contents__scroll-section>Little information available about the murder</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/c4c9e1ad146f21c0.jpg><p class=align-left>The Nick Cordova murder remains mysterious as police have shared little information with the public. Although there was a rumour of death in Guadalupe Road immediately after his murder, it took weeks for the story to hit the news.</p><p class=align-left>The most interesting thing is that the information was available to the public via a GoFundMe by Alysha. Nick Cordova's murder wasn't made public until the police wanted assistance in identifying two prime suspects. Also, they haven't released information about how he died. The Gilbert Police are investigating the case as a homicide.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/b08b3b1c58f6885b.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Tracie Hawlett and JB Beasley: What happened and latest updates</span></p></a><h2 id=427118-two-possible-suspects class=table-of-contents__scroll-section>Two possible suspects</h2><p class=align-left>Even though detectives have not stated how Nick Cordova died, they have identified two suspects fleeing the scene shortly after his murder. And one of the suspects was captured by surveillance video at a nearby convenience store.</p><p class=align-left>The two suspects in the murder case arrived at the gas station near Nick Cordova’s business minutes after the murder. Unfortunately, no specifics about the two individuals have been released by the police.</p><p class=align-left>The Gilbert Police urges the public to watch the video and report any information they might have about the two people. The person appears to be 5'8'' with a heavy build. According to police reports, he seems to be either Hispanic or Native American.</p><h2 id=427118-alysha-nick39s-wife-speaks-her-mind class=table-of-contents__scroll-section>Alysha, Nick's wife, speaks her mind</h2><p class=align-left>Alysha Cordova, Nick Cordova's wife, has always expressed her mind about the case and urges the public to come out with information that will capture the two suspects. In one of her statements, she says:</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/ce3a616087e9ca76.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>What happened to Christinna from 16 & Pregnant?

We're never going to be OK…just finding the people behind this will give us some closure, if possible.<p class=align-left>Also, she had the following to say <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">six months after the murder</a> of his husband:</p>It makes reality set in a little bit more than this is real life, and he's not just on vacation, and he's not going to be home, and he's not going to be here for the things that he should be here for.<p class=align-left>Alysha Cordova has also spoke with a <a href=#>YouTuber</a> named <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Tyson Draper</a>, giving great details about the case. She pieces together the facts of the case currently available.</p><p class=align-left>Something that stood out in the video was that Nick Cordova had a silent business partner who was rarely in the office. However, it seems that he was in the office during Nick Cordova's murder. So, who is Nick Cordova's partner?</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/9b538e7b60e42781.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=29><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Citizen TV Zora: full story, cast names, photos and profiles</span></p></a><p class=align-left>There hasn't been any information about the identity of the silent partner. However, it seems that during the scuffle that led to Nick's death, the silent partner was knocked out. Of course, the scenario is strange as police never reported another individual had been injured during the incident. And since she mentions it in the video, it appears to be an essential detail.</p><h2 id=427118-gofundme-campaign-and-10000-reward class=table-of-contents__scroll-section>GoFundMe campaign and $10,000 reward</h2><p class=align-left>A GoFundMe campaign was set up to raise money for the family of Alysha Cordova.
