It’s the art of nine limbs and virtually anything goes. You can headbutt (the ninth limb), you can suplex, and, crucially, you fight bare-knuckle.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The unmistakable 6’2 Canadian, who began his career fighting Muay Thai, opted to switch to Myanmar’s more brutal equivalent and has taken to it like a duck to water. The 28-year-old has produced famous performances against local Burmese legends like Too Too and Tun Tun Min during a meteoric rise and soon found himself with a regal collection of world title belts as well as a legion of new fans.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">His last encounter was arguably his masterpiece. In front of a packed crowd in the ancient Burmese city of Mandalay, Leduc unleashed four knock-downs to finish UFC alumni Seth Baczynski and clinch the inaugural World Lethwei Championship (WLC) cruiserweight title.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The fight attracted millions of viewers worldwide and was a landmark moment for the sport, and its greatest champion. With WLC aired on UFC Fight Pass, Lethwei has begun to attract interest from a new, intrigued, international audience – and with the pandemic still largely in full flow, fans have been wondering when they’ll get to see Leduc in action again.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“I’m itching for a fight,” Leduc told SCMP MMA. “I really want it and I’m training in the gym harder than ever. I’m knocking out guys and I’m training hard. I just really want a fight right now.”</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-TitleText class="css-66qo9a eeeqn932">‘Born in Myanmar in another life’, Canadian fighter turns Burmese hero</span></p></a></h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Judging by its recently-released schedule, WLC intends to oblige him, with proposed shows in Myanmar, Cambodia, Bangkok, Tokyo and even the US next year. In terms of who he’ll face, Leduc has a few choice opponents in mind.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“Cyrus Washington is campaigning for the rematch. This is unfinished business for me. I completely lacerated his face last time and he wants more? Perfect, let’s do it,” Leduc said.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“There’s also Joe Schilling. I’m all for it. I think he’s also a friend of Joe Rogan’s so it would be interesting to see who Joe would cheer for. I saw his motto is, ‘You can’t stop crazy’ or something? Well maybe in kick-boxing when you have pillow gloves and a limited ruleset, but when you go in Lethwei you’ll really see what crazy is.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/methode/2020/08/04/24ee6898-d624-11ea-a9df-dfa023813e67_972x_200000.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">A middleweight champion in Glory, Schilling has won WBC world titles in Muay Thai and has put in some big performances in MMA and kick-boxing for Bellator. At 6’3 and with serious knockout power he would represent a unique challenge.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">One other potential match-up further down the line would see Leduc get the chance to claim another world title belt. Here, he would take on former Tiger Muay Thai teammate, Naimjon Tuhtaboyev who’s the WLC middleweight champ.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“It’s a possibility,” Leduc said. “I respect Naimjon. We trained at Tiger, and he was a fierce training partner. They were good exchanges. But it’s going to be like all my other fights. He’s a very tough guy but I’d be taller than him, stronger than him. No one is better than me in the clinch. Let’s see him defend his belt first and then let’s sign the contract.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/methode/2020/08/04/45285ba0-d624-11ea-a9df-dfa023813e67_972x_200000.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">There is one more fascinating rumour that refuses to go away. Leduc has long been linked to a super fight against Muay Thai legend Buakaw Banchamek.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">It’s widely understood this would not be a bare-knuckle affair, and although the promoter of “The White Lotus” has strongly denied the rumours, Leduc insists the blockbuster fight is under negotiation – but said he has to remain tight-lipped for now.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tK%2FMqWWcp51kwLG70a1mppmiqbaiuIyaqa2rX6K2ubHDZqSaqqSerq15wKurrGeRp8Gqr8ueZmxoaWt9cn6OnZivnV2hsqXBwmagrZuYnruoecWinqGsXay8s7jDZqOerJissqo%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 DashJ - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
