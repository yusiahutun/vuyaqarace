Its stated goals are to build partnerships with civil society groups, think tanks, and non-governmental groups in democratic countries, support democratisation in Asia, and to further Taiwan’s democratic development through international exchanges.</p>In practice, this has meant hosting international delegations and conferences, publishing research, and providing grant funding to support democracy and <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">human rights-related activities</span></a>.<h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-TitleText class="css-66qo9a eeeqn932">DPP does not reflect mainstream Taiwan, Beijing’s point man tells industry group</span></p></a></h3>Some in the ruling <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">Democratic Progressive Party (DPP)</span></a> have voiced concerns about what Han’s chairmanship would mean for Taiwan. Hong Sun-han, a DPP legislator, said this week that many in Taiwanese civil society feared that Han could use the TFD to advance cross-strait “integration work” as the administration of former Taiwanese president Ma Ying-jeou did during its tenure.<p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Han is expected to assume the role later this month.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The foundation is typically chaired by the island’s legislative president, with the minister of foreign affairs serving as the vice-chairman and the secretary general of the president’s office as director.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Its other board members are legislators – nominated proportionally to party representation in the legislature – as well as representatives from academia, non-governmental organisations and the financial sector.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">In 2022, after then-US House speaker Nancy Pelosi visited Taiwan, Beijing banned the foundation from cooperating with mainland organisations, businesses and individuals, saying it had “wantonly carried out ‘Taiwan independence’ separatist activities in the international arena”.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Whether those sanctions could be lifted under Han’s chairmanship remained to be seen, but his leadership could have a positive impact on Taiwan’s contact with the mainland, Tso Chen-Dong, professor of international relations at National Taiwan University, said in an interview with local media.</p>Han lost Taiwan’s presidential election to the DPP’s Tsai Ing-wen in 2020 and was <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">recalled as Kaohsiung mayor</span></a> shortly after. But he topped the opposition KMT’s party list in this year’s elections.<p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Han’s pro-Beijing politics are viewed with extreme scepticism by the independence-leaning DPP, particularly following a 2019 visit to Hong Kong and mainland China in which he met then-Hong Kong chief executive Carrie Lam and several Communist Party officials.</p>As lawmakers voted in the speaker election last month, some Taiwanese groups protested outside the island’s legislature, holding banners saying “Han Kuo-yu brings in the <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">Communist Party</span></a>”.<h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-TitleText class="css-66qo9a eeeqn932">KMT deputy chief Andrew Hsia starts mainland China trip with call for dialogue</span></p></a></h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">But the near-even split in the island’s new legislature meant the foundation’s activities probably would not change much under the new government, said Chen Fang-yu, a professor of political science at Soochow University in Taipei. However, the KMT’s slight majority means the organisation’s budget could face challenges.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Chen said the KMT’s legislative majority during Ma’s tenure allowed then-legislative president Wang Jin-pyng to turn the TFD into a “foundation for cross-strait relations”.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“Many people found that the TFD became a travel agency to always give funding to cross-strait relations, not the promotion of human rights or democracy,” Chen said.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“However, because the DPP is the ruling party, that won’t happen. I don’t think Han Kuo-yu has the ability to turn the TFD into a role similar to under Ma Ying-jeou.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">There was media speculation that the DPP might try to block Han from assuming the chairmanship, but the party’s leadership dismissed those suggestions.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Chen said the real gridlock would happen over negotiations for the roles of CEO and three vice-CEOs, because they played a direct role in running the organisation. Those negotiations are expected to continue throughout the month.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tK%2FMqWWcp51ku6bD0miaoaGelnyxu8uiq6Kbo2Sus8DInKOeZ2NngnSElHBmppmZo7miusNmmqGhnpZ6p77InqWdpKliwaK11pqlnquVYrmiw8yaop6qXam2sbzEnWSlnZGZeqi%2Bzq6nZqyRqLimsIypqailn6m2r7OMnZymp5OnrqTF</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 DashJ - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
