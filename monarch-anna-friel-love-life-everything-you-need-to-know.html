Normally you can busy yourself, and go to meet other people, but to actually have a break-up and be on my own during lockdown just with my daughter."</p><h2>Anna Friel's relationship with David Thewlis</h2><p id=eKYSPLqGr1QY data-wc=48>In 2001, Anna began dating fellow actor David Thewlis after the pair met on a flight. David is best known for his roles in the Harry Potter films as Remus Lupin, The Theory of Everything alongside Eddie Redmayne, and the 2020 Netflix film I'm Thinking of Ending Things.</p><p id=echR2kP7P5TS data-wc=82>Although the pair never married, they did welcome a child together. Their daughter, Gracie, was born in 2005 and has gone on to&nbsp;start an acting career of her own. David and Anna split in 2010 after almost ten years together but have remained on great terms and both live close by to co-parent Gracie. Anna later said of the relationship: "<strong>We do the school run together or if Gracie needs new shoes, the three of us go off shoe shopping together."</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/62bf5886cee9-anna-frield-david-thewlis-z.jpg><p id=eneD004M6slb data-wc=13><strong>Anna and David dated for almost ten years and share a daughter together</strong></p><h2>Anna Friel's relationship with Rhys Ifans</h2><p id=epw8pCFNIebM data-wc=37>After her split from David, Anna then went on to date fellow actor Rhys Ifans for three years, but they called it quits in 2014. Much like with her split from David, the two remained great friends.</p><p id=e0m_wIBZ4uCA data-wc=46>She told Red magazine at the time: "In both relationships, things didn't break down because there was no love there. In reality, it was just because we'd become friends, or we were spending too much time apart, and that's actors for you – that's our industry."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/11dadecc7f4c-anna-friel-rhys-ifans-z.jpg><p id=e11vNNIHDwA5 data-wc=6><strong>Anna with her ex Rhys Ifans</strong></p><h2>Anna Friel's other past loves</h2><p id=eOPcJfuaPKCe data-wc=36>The Marcella actress, who has been nominated for a string of awards throughout her career including a Golden Globe and a BAFTA, has also dated a number of other famous faces including Darren Day and <strong><a class=hm-link href=#>Robbie Williams</a>.</strong></p><p id=ezGrHB2O4FoO data-wc=24>The TV star was also reported&nbsp;to have dated&nbsp;Joaquin Phoenix, Christian Bale, and Chris Evans in the nineties, but these were never confirmed.&nbsp;</p><p id=e28wh5eWQ4DS data-wc=4><strong>Read more <a class=hm-link href=#>HELLO!
