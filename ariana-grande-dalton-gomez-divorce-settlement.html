According to sources, the couple just couldn’t make it work post-COVID and the level of Grande’s fame wasn’t something Gomez was at all prepared for. “When Covid restrictions lifted, we’re told their differences became alarmingly apparent. Dalton, an L.A. realtor, was taken aback by Ariana’s celebrity. He had not dealt with her schedule, the paparazzi and the various opportunities that took her out of L.A.,”&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href=#>TMZ reported</a>. “We’re told Dalton would sometimes question why they needed to go around town with security, something that was a must for Ariana. Their differences started to make the marriage unravel, and it was greatly exacerbated when she went to England last December to begin filming&nbsp;Wicked.</p><p>he gossip site spoke to sources with insider knowledge of the couple, saying that they’ve been separated “since January” and while they tried to reconcile, they’re “heading for divorce.” According to TMZ, they’d been spending “miles apart” since December 2022 when she started filming&nbsp;Wicked&nbsp;but their sources say the problems started before that. Though, it appears they “remain friends” and “still talk on the phone regularly”. Apparently, Gomez has been dating since they separated and that’s been fine with Grande.</p><p>This lines up with what has been reported elsewhere. They apparently separated earlier this year and “have been quietly and lovingly working on their friendship” since, a source confirmed to People. Meanwhile, two sources told&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Us Weekly</a>&nbsp;that their split had been coming for a while. “Ariana and Dalton have been having some issues for months now,” an insider said. “They were having issues before she left for Wicked filming [in London] that they couldn’t resolve, and the distance did not help. They haven’t been speaking and are separated, and a divorce is likely.” The second source said: “Things had been going really well for Ariana and Dalton since they got married. But unfortunately, they hit a rough patch a few months ago and haven’t been able to recover.”</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=5.7025316455696><h2>Who is Ariana Grande dating now?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/ariana-grande-ethan-slater-still-together.jpg><p>Ariana Grande is reportedly dating Ethan Slater.
