Sometimes, however, those jokes lead to wild rumors, like the one that she had her breasts insured. Parton set the record straight about that particular tall tale during a Jan. 26 stop on NBC's Today With Hoda & Jenna.</p><p>"It's not true," Parton clarifies with a laugh.</p><p>Rumors that Parton's breasts were insured started heating up after model Heidi Klum revealed on the <a href=#>Ellen Show</a> that she had insured her legs for $2 million. If Klum's signature body part could be insured, many fans wondered, why shouldn't Dolly's world-famous breasts get the same treatment?</p><p>But Parton explains that she's been joking about insuring her boobs for years, inspired by another star who insured her legs for $1 million: Actor and pinup star Betty Grable.</p><p>"Years ago, it was Betty Grable, or one of the great famous stars that was famous also for her legs? At that time, I said, 'Well, maybe I should get my boobs insured since I'm famous for them.'"</p><p>But, she adds, "It was just a joke. I did not do that."</p><p>It wasn't really a fair comparison between the body parts, she goes on to say, quipping, "You can get new boobs, but you can't get new legs."</p><p>Parton's kicking off 2022 with a flurry of new career endeavors. She just launched her own line of cake mixes with Duncan Hines, and in March, she'll release her first-ever novel,&nbsp;Run Rose Run, which she co-wrote with author James Patterson. Parton is also putting out a companion album of the same title.</p><p><strong>See Dolly Parton's Life and Career in Pictures</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskajBprvFnKaupqSnxm%2BvzqZmnaecocZuvMCrq6imXZe%2Fpq3SrapmoZ6owrOxw2g%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 DashJ - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
