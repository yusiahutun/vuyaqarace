The singer stepped out last weekend wearing head-to-toe leopard print as she celebrated her friend Melissa Forde’s birthday at trendy West Hollywood restaurant The Nice Guy, teaming her bustier mini dress with a Dolce & Gabbana floor-length fur-trimmed coat and fluffy clutch bag by Louis Vuitton. The Dolce is one of a collection of leopard-print coats currently taking up space in Rihanna’s wardrobe, having showcased a Bottega Venetta faux fur version earlier this year. And Rihanna’s not the only one having a leopard moment: Sofia Richie Grainge, Kendall Jenner and Dua Lipa have all sworn their allegiance to the feline flag.</p><img alt="los angeles, ca october 20 kendall jenner is seen on october 20, 2023 in los angeles, california photo by rachpootbauer griffingc images" title="Celebrity Sightings In Los Angeles - October 20, 2023" width=2066 height=3100 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/gettyimages-1736507714-661fac0d32413.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Rachpoot/Bauer-Griffin</span></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=2 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Designers have also rediscovered their love of leopard print in the past two seasons. Dolce & Gabbana have been the kings of the jungle in this respect, ever since their very first collection in AW91. For SS24, they had a leopard print for every weather, from a mac with matching hood to a chiffon dress with thigh-high split. Meanwhile Jacquemus’ take was an homage to the screen sirens of the 1940s with a nipped in waist belt and power shoulders, while Hedi Slimane opted for a more Nineties look with models in minis and matching jackets at Celine. For AW24, Dior’s girls wore leopard twinsets, knitted skirts and coats worthy of <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.harpersbazaar.com/uk/culture/culture-news/a45530737/truman-capote-swans-true-story/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Truman Capote's Swans" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">Truman Capote's Swans</a>.</p><img alt="a woman wearing a black and white dress and a black and white skirt" title="a woman wearing a black and white dress and a black and white skirt" width=1320 height=1980 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/christian-dior-f24-056-661fafab15c66.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">launchmetrics.com/spotlight</span><p>Dior AW24</p><img alt="a person in a dress" title="a person in a dress" width=1320 height=1980 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/jacquemus-po-s24-028-661fafba6da83.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Courtesy of Jacquemus</span><p>Jacquemus SS24</p><h6 class="css-ok56rr e94w1mj3"><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p0"></span><span class="css-8lle59 e94w1mj1">Related Story</span><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p1"></span></h6><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=5 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">And while some have lumped the return of leopard print in with the Mob Wife aesthetic (which it does undoubtedly fit in to: see Carmela Soprano for reference), its history is actually far more complicated than that. Indeed, in many ways, no print has enjoyed such contradictory associations: can you think of anything else that has simultaneously been a status symbol for the wealthy and shorthand for tacky and cheap?</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=7 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">When leopard print was first in vogue, it was wealthy aristocrats and royals who made it so, bringing home the real thing and fashioning it into coats, rugs and the like. By the early 20th century, fur coats had become more accessible for the middle classes, and flapper girls particularly coveted leopard fur as the most expensive. It was around this time that it started to be found printed on evening dresses and accessories, but it wasn’t until 1947 that it got its high fashion makeover courtesy of Christian Dior, who became the first designer to put it on the catwalk. It was still very much associated with wealth in the 1960s, when former First Lady Jackie Kennedy’s leopard fur coat inadvertently caused a drop in the animal population (the practice of hunting leopards was eventually banned in 1973).</p><img alt="jackie kennedy leaving a manhattan building wearing a leopard skin coat and white turtleneck photo by sal trainawwdpenske media via getty images" title="Jackie Kennedy on the Street" width=6990 height=7152 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/gettyimages-1440842185-661fa9a49a260.jpeg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">WWD</span><p>Jackie Kennedy</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=9 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">But the 1960s also saw the class divisions of society begin to melt, as rock stars and princesses hung out together. It was at this time that leopard started to be associated with the countercultural movement, led by Rolling Stones guitarist Keith Richards and his aristocratic girlfriend Anita Pallenberg, who often borrowed each others’ clothes. It was its adoption by the male stars of the next decade – David Bowie, Rod Stewart and Freddie Mercury – that would cement its status as rock n roll.</p><img alt="rolling stone keith richards and his girlfriend anita pallenberg, 9th december 1969 photo by mccarthydaily expresshulton archivegetty images" title="Richards And Pallenberg" width=6751 height=4992 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/gettyimages-2641007-661faa4a1a22d.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">McCarthy</span><p>Anita Pallenberg and Keith Richards in 1969</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=11 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Hollywood is perhaps responsible for leopard print’s next iteration as the clothing choice of the sexually predatory woman. In 1967, Ann Bancroft’s frustrated housewife wore it in The Graduate; 32 years later Patricia Arquette rocked it as call-girl Alabama in True Romance. At some point, this switched again, with it suddenly associated with both in-your-face-ness (see: Scary Spice) and cheapness (see: Kat Slater of Eastenders fame).</p><img alt="american actress anne bancroft 1931 2005 wears a leopard print coat as she talks on the phone, drinks, and smokes in character as the seductive older woman, mrs robinson, in a still from the film the graduate directed by mike nichols, california, 1967 photo by embassy picturesmgm studioscourtesy of getty images" title="Anne Bancroft In &amp;apos;The Graduate&amp;apos;" width=3104 height=4056 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/gettyimages-53037074-661faa0acee08.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">MGM Studios</span><p>Anne Bancroft in The Graduate</p><img alt="united kingdom february 10 brit awards, london arena photo of mel b and spice girls, melanie brown mel b performing live on stage, leopard print photo by mick hutsonredferns" title="Photo of Mel B and SPICE GIRLS" width=3256 height=4942 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/gettyimages-85234877-661faaa8aa2f4.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Mick Hutson</span><p>Mel B "Scary&nbsp;Spice" in 1998&nbsp;</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=13 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">In 2024, leopard print is thankfully no longer shorthand for rich or poor taste. But we wouldn’t say it’s a neutral: it’s still got a sexiness and a punk appeal. That’s why it might be the only print ballsy enough to oust the ubiquitous Quiet Luxury trend. In the battle to topple this, we’ve picked our player – and it’s Rihanna.</p><img data-dynamic-svg=true src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.harpersbazaar.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/play.db7c035.svg?primary=%2523ffffff" data-testid=dynamic-svg-base height=24 width=24 alt="Play Icon" role=img title=Play style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><img alt="preview for Highlights from the Autumn/Winter 2024 fashion weeks" title="Video player poster image" width=2000 height=1000 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/vidthumb/images/hbz-aw24-highlights-thumb-1-65f33699d960e.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><h6 class="css-ok56rr e94w1mj3"><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p0"></span><span class="css-8lle59 e94w1mj1">Related Story</span><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p1"></span></h6><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qa3RqZyrq5KWx6Kt0WeaqKVfqrhwssCsn6KnnmSzor%2FHoqanZZ6axLR7wG9nbmphaYN4e8eiqq2noq56sLKMpZyoqJGnsW680aKlrWc%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 DashJ - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
