Wondering about <a href=#>Donna Kelce’s net worth</a>? Keep reading to find out.</p><p>Mama Kelce hails from Cleveland, and before being a dedicated NFL mom, she held high-level positions in finance (which we’ll get to below). Donna revealed on her sons’ joint podcast New Heights with Jason and <a href=# id=auto-tag_travis-kelce data-tag=travis-kelce>Travis Kelce</a> that she met her now ex-husband, and their father Ed, while on her way to another date. Before going to a play, she stopped at a bar where Ed was enjoying an after-work drink. “I was supposed to go out with a guy that night. We were supposed to go to a play, and I never made it. Your dad and I talked forever,” Donna told her sons. “It was a good play, too! I really wanted to see it.”</p><p>Related Stories</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/travis-kelce-kiss-marry-kill-taylor-swift.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/reba-mcentire-taylor-swift.jpg><p>Donna and Ed got married in the late ’70s. They welcomed their older son Jason in Nov. 1987 and Travis shortly after in Oct. 1989. They raised their family in Cleveland Heights, Ohio, and their sons both went to the University of Cincinnati to play college football. After Jason and Travis graduated from college, the couple decided to separate after roughly 25 years of marriage. Donna said that she holds no ill will toward their father.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/travis-kelce-parents-2.png><p>“I don’t hate him. We’re friends to this day. We get along great,” Donna explained on the podcast. “We were like a tag team with you two. We got to do all sorts of fun things. When one of you had to go out of town, the other person would help with the other child. It was perfect.”</p><p>Both Donna and Ed have supported their sons’ football careers by cheering them on the sidelines.

The best-selling book delves into the history of the first Super Bowl, which was originally known as the AFL-NFL Championship Game. (The term “Super Bowl” was coined only in its third year.) The debut game, between the winning Green Bay Packers and the Kansas City Chiefs, was played in front of only 61,946 people at&nbsp;the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum—an audience well&nbsp;below the stadium’s capacity. Harvey Frommer, a sports historian and reporter, puts the tale of that momentous game together using oral history, gathered by hundreds of interviews with players, coaches, media and spectators alike.</p><p>Our mission at STYLECASTER is to bring style to the people, and we only feature products we think you’ll love as much as we do.
