However, his tour bus got <a href=# rel>stuck</a> in a storm and he had to ultimately <a href=# rel>reschedule</a> the show. Kreischer subsequently took to social media to seek help from local residents -- and he wasn't disappointed.</p><p><strong>ALSO READ</strong></p><p><a href=# rel>'I'm pleasantly surprised when people see my growth. I wish my wife saw it too!' Bert Kreischer on whether he has grown as a comedian</a></p><p><a href=# rel>Five high school seniors wake up at dawn to shovel neighbor's driveway during snowstorm so she could attend life-saving dialysis</a></p><p>"Hey Bismarck, if you’ve got a snow plow," Kreischer said in a video posted to his Instagram Stories, "I know you’re probably using it right now, we could use some help." He added, “Or just come on over and bring some Schnapps, it’s pretty f****** cold out here."</p><p>The Bismarck community rushed to the comedian's rescue. <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">The Blaze</a> reported how George Pehl of Guthmiller and Son Dirt Works was plowing near the state Capitol when he received a call to assist the embattled crew. Kreischer couldn't contain his excitement when Pehl and his "front-end loader" arrived at the scene. Referencing the bible, Kreischer stated, "You ask, man...Ask and thou shalt receive." He continued, "This is what our country's about. North Dakota showed the f*** up!" Pehl said he was glad to help but he had to get back to work, unfortunately. "I wish I would have had more time to visit, but I had to get back to snow removal," he said as he continued to plow snow Friday morning, November 11.</p><p>Several North Dakotans followed suit, showing up with their shovels and plows to save the bus as well as liquor to spread the cheer in the freezing cold. Kreischer made sure he gave credit to those who helped, sharing their faces and even naming some local businesses like Dan’s Supermarket. The comedian, who is originally from Florida, gushed about the generous and neighborly spirit of the local community.&nbsp;"This is my Joe Rogan thought of the day," Kreischer said. "When you live in a place where Mother Nature is in control, people are nicer. Look at them. They’re helping each other out. I hate to say this out loud, but I don't think you'd see this in L.A. You’d see people looting each other’s houses and be like, 'Oh man, free car, that’s my car.'"</p><p>At one point, he was seen standing outside in a blizzard with a group of Samaritans who brought along a Fireball Whisky Party Bucket, a Pabst Blue Ribbon pounder and a bottle of Swede Hill Apple Pie Moonshine. "Cheers to North Dakota," Kreischer said as they celebrated pulling his bus to safety. His Bismarck show, originally scheduled for Thursday, was rescheduled for March 22.</p><p>Meanwhile, the Friday show in Fargo was rescheduled for February 28. Kreischer reassured his fans that all tickets previously purchased for the affected dates would be honored.</p><p dir=ltr lang=en>Due to weather delays in Bismarck, tonight's performance at Scheel's Arena in Fargo, ND has been rescheduled to February 28,2023.
