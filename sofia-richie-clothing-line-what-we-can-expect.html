The daughter of Lionel Richie shot to sartorial stardom this year after her glamorous Chanel-clad wedding in the South of France in April. It was two days before her big day that she created her <a class=hm-link href=# rel=nofollow>TikTok&nbsp;</a>account and started sharing 'GRWM' (get ready with me) videos, which gained her a cult following on the platfotm. As of August 2023, the hashtag #sofiarichiestyle has a staggering 404 million views, proving her momumental inlfluence in the fashion sphere. Therefore it seems only right that she is starting her very own label.</p><p id=e-KhAaq0vCw data-wc=12><strong>MORE:&nbsp;</strong><a class=hm-link href=#>Sofia Richie added an unexpected brand to her quiet luxury wardrobe</a></p><p id=eH-CUp0lJ3 data-wc=16><strong>READ: <a class=hm-link href=#>Sofia Richie just wore an affordable Rixo dress - here's similar ones to shop now</a>&nbsp;</strong></p><p id=ezLS-y_AyX data-wc=10>Here's everything we know so far about what to expect...</p><h2><strong>What will Sofia Richie's clothing line look like?</strong></h2><p id=exfSF38y1J data-wc=82>“The aesthetic is very my vibe,” she told <strong>Who What Wear</strong>. If her signature dress code is anything to go by, it's going to be effortlessly chic, minimalistic, elevated and timeless. When meeting her stylist Liat Baruch for the first time, Sofia explained that 'timeless' was their word for finding her own style agenda. She also said in the interview that Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis is her ultimate style muse. We're expecting it to rival the likes of The Row, Khaite and Celine...</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/c79a675cabc9-snapinstaapp3425869229378554840806598702544886603533047n1080.jpg><h2><strong>Will Sofia Richie design her own clothes?</strong></h2><p id=eSDIhqetT6Z data-wc=76>Sofia is co-designing the collection with her upcoming brand's designer named Cass, “She’s brilliant, and it was kind of the same vibe as when I started putting together wedding looks with Liat,” she says. “I had Cass come to my house, and we sat in my backyard in sweatpants. We started with things in life that inspire us. For me, it was art and music. We built this whole story based on things that inspire us.”&nbsp;</p><p id=egYLoBoKKum data-wc=71>She also explains that she's taking a leaf out of her sister, Nicole Richie's book, who also has her own label named House of Harlow. “I’ve watched Nicole design for years with House of Harlow, and it has definitely been inspiring for me. I’ve taken notes, and I’ve learned a lot. We don’t need to be people that just throw our names on things. We can be passionate and be involved.”&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/2efbb76c26ea-snapinstaapp34291425711650816108436811179401175920652146n1080.jpg><h2><strong>Who is Sofia Richie's clothing line designed for?</strong></h2><p id=ejm2UsXVvR data-wc=64>“I want whoever buys it to feel good in it. I hope that people connect with it. I hope people love it,” she said, rather than a specific celebrity or event. “I feel powerful in what I wear. I really tuned into myself and asked, what am I wearing when I feel my most powerful self? And that was in more sophisticated, timeless attire.”</p><h2 data-gid=eLPHeDIoJJ><strong data-gid=efVKHH5hmB>When will Sofia Richie's clothing line be released?</strong></h2><p id=ezMN6MArBnQ data-wc=33>Though a launch date hasn't officially been announced, the collection is well underway. “I made sure, trying on every single sample, that it embodies the aesthetic that I've been wearing.
