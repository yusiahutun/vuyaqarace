"They asked me to be one 10 years ago."</p><p>The Dead to Me star turned down the role but later wound up becoming friends with the show's executive producer through their kids at school. When she asked him years later if he thought she would have made a good Housewife, he shut it down.</p><p class=quote-block__text>I wouldn't have shown up to any dinners.

"I wouldn't have shown up to any dinners," she said. "I would have been in my sweatpants and I'd be laying in bed."</p><p>"What fun is that?" she asked. "No. I would be the worst Housewife anyway."</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:4ebc6aa7-8cd2-4ec9-b167-a61812f1be67 data-container-ref=toofab:article:74715d63-b0e9-4f9e-87ed-bdae6be63073 data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=28><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/f6/5by4/2024/04/10/f6f909d804764e7e8f86824fc4d3b2a5_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">Getty</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">Christina Applegate Often Thinks It Would Be Easier on Loved Ones If She Was 'Not Here' Amid MS Battle</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><p>As it turns out, though, Applegate isn't even a huge fan of the show ... or at least, there's another show she prefers. That came out when Short asked her if she could find herself hanging out with any of the Housewives just day-to-day.</p><p>Applegate didn't even really hesitate, saying, "No, not at all," before quickly apologizing, "I'm sorry, guys, for the reaction." That apology was probably for the ones she has since befriended. It's not that she dislikes the Housewives, it's just that she would rather hang with the cast of another show.</p><p>In fact, she said she's dropped into the DMs and befriended even more of the crew from <a href=#><strong>Below Deck</strong></a> than the Housewives franchise. "I'm more of the Below Deck people because they are interesting," she explained.</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:4e13f453-703e-4e3a-abaa-e398f0952f58 data-container-ref=toofab:article:74715d63-b0e9-4f9e-87ed-bdae6be63073 data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=28><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/32/5by4/2024/03/26/3244ff2c43ef46a7b6a76e65db8eda18_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">Getty</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">Christina Applegate Jokes Dax Shepard 'Physically Assaulted' Her While Acting as 'Security' for Wife Kristen Bell</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><p>While she's not going to be holding a diamond anytime soon, Applegate remains a Housewives and reality TV junkie, admitting that she's probably watched 300 hours of it from her bed in just the past two years.</p><p>She's such a fan, she even felt emboldened enough to call out <a href=#><strong>Andy Cohen</strong></a> over <a href=#><strong>Robyn Dixon</strong></a> getting "fired" from <a href=#><strong>The Real Housewives of Potomac</strong></a>.</p><p>"What in the actual f--k," she posted to <a href=#><strong>X/Twitter</strong></a> last week when the story broke.
