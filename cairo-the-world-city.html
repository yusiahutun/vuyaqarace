The metropolitan area of Cairo has a population of about 20 million, which is the largest in Africa, the Arab world, the Middle East, and also the 6th largest in the world.</p><p>Founded in 969 AD by the Fatimid Dynasty, Cairo was a site of the ancient national capital, the remnants of which can still be seen in Old Cairo. Since then, The city has been the center of the region’s political and cultural life. Because of the predominance of Islamic Architecture, the city is also titled ‘the city of thousand minarets.’</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Let’s dig into a little history of the Cairo City:</h2><p>In the year 969 AD, the Fatimids had conquered Egypt. They started building a city, which was to serve as the capital of their empire. It took as much as four years to build the city, which was initially named al-Manṣūriyyah. It was later renamed Cairo. The city eventually became the center of learning, as <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">the library of Cairo</a> contained thousands of books.</p><p>During the middle ages, even though the city avoided the stagnation of the Europeans, it had no escape from the Black Death. The Black Death or the Plague was one of the deadliest pandemics recorded in human history. This pandemic struck the city more than 50 times between 1348 and 1517. With the pandemic, Cairo’s population faced a major blow and had diminished the status of the city to certain levels.</p><p>This status stooped lower when Vasco da Gama discovered a sea route around the Cape of Good Hope. With this discovery, the spice traders then were able to avoid Cairo on their way to their desired destination. The city’s political influence diminished, even more, when the Ottomans supplanted the Mamluk power over Egypt in the year 1517. By the 18th century, The city was the second-largest empire behind Constantinople.</p><p>Today, Greater The city is the largest metropolitan area in Africa.</p><p><a href=#>Munich – A Celebration Of All Things Good</a></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Cairo – A Cultural Centre</h2><p>A city is a place that exhibits love for all sorts of arts.
