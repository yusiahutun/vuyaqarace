Trevor’s girlfriend, now ex, is Natalia Marrero. She is a North Carolina-based bodybuilder. The two were together before he was cast in Love Is Blind season 6. Trevor and Natalia started seeing each other in September 2022. As production came closer, she agreed to let him star on the show for financial reasons and kept her updated with texts when the show was filming.</p><p>Among those texts included a promise that he’ll marry her when the show is over. Love Is Blind TikToker Rikkii <a rel=nofollow href=# data-type=link data-id="https://www.tiktok.com/@storytimewithrikkii/video/7338659649144507691?_r=1&_t=8k8IIiMjA4I">broke down</a> the messages in a seven-minute long TikTok which has been viewed over a million times.</p><p>Trevor ended up dumping Natalia weeks before the show premiered. “I honestly think he would’ve never spoken to me again if I hadn’t made him,” Natalia told<a href=# data-type=link data-id=https://www.businessinsider.com/trevor-love-is-blind-girlfriend-rumors-tiktok-jimmy-jeramey-engagement-2024-2 rel=nofollow> Business Insider</a>. “I made him talk to me and he broke up with me. And that was literally two weeks before the show came out.”</p><p>The bodybuilder came forward with her story as a healing process. “I don’t want to hurt Trevor in any way, shape, or form, but I was hurting really badly,” Natalia told BI. “It was really hard for me to see him being portrayed the way that he was, and really leaning into that on social media, knowing the truth.”</p><p>She continued, “It was really hard for me to think that if I stayed silent he would continue on feeding the persona he was portrayed as on the show,” she says. “And then would’ve acted like I had never existed for the rest of his life.”</p><p>When asked about his girlfriend during the Love Is Blind Season 6 reunion, Trevor told the cast that he and his girlfriend weren’t “technically” dating when he joined the show. “I had a whole thing planned to say, I don’t know. I was not dating her, ‘dating her’ technically, I never said, ‘Will you be my girlfriend?’ before the show started, but… obviously, we were close,” he said. “She was the typical girl I’d go for in real life,” he continued. “I told her before [that] I want to go on this to try and experiment with something else. There’s no justifying that — that sounds f—ing horrible what I just said.”</p><p>Trevor went on to say, “I wanted to do this. I wanted to meet somebody that I wouldn’t go for in real life. That’s f—ed up.” He added that he “went in with the mindset of ‘I will find someone, I wanna try it.'” “I don’t f—ing know, there isn’t an answer for that.”</p><p>He also called himself and his ex-girlfriend “toxic.” “I’m toxic as well, I admit that. I need a lot of therapy,” he said. “I know I f—ing need to change. I don’t know what you want me to say.”</p><p>Host Vanessa Lachey defended Trevor in an interview with <a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href=# data-type=link data-id=https://people.com/vanessa-lachey-defends-love-is-blind-trevor-sova-amid-secret-girlfriend-rumors-exclusive-8608968>People</a> after the reunion. “I think Trevor is figuring himself out, and I think he didn’t realize the scope of what this meant, either,” she said. “He does talk about that at the reunion, and this is something that Nick and I really try to emphasize when we first see them in the pods: ‘Be honest for yourself, so you can allow yourself this true experience, and to find that person that loves you no matter what. But also, because when this part happens and when it hits Netflix and people around the world know about it, there’s no skeletons in your closet. There’s no hiding behind anything. If you come out and just own who you are or what’s going on, then you’re in a good place.'”</p><p>She continued, “I don’t know that he really understood the scope of it, and I’m hoping that he does now, and sees that could be hurtful to both women. But yeah, he’s going through a lot, and I’m proud of him for coming and saying his piece. It’s just not fair to everyone if you’re holding back or lying to other people there. And also, that was a position that maybe another guy could have had, that maybe someone else could have met their partner. You know, all the other women who didn’t meet a guy, maybe that spot that he took could have been another guy. But maybe he didn’t think that way.”</p><p>Vanessa also encouraged viewers to not make their own judgements about Trevor until after watching the Love Is Blind reunion. “You’ll have to watch his reaction at the reunion and deduce your own reasoning for his thought process. But yeah, human nature is fascinating, and I think that’s also a wonderful reason this works, so we shall see,” she said.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmirpK65pq%2FArKueql6YvK57y6Kqratfqb%2Bmws6rZKChoqGzs7XEp5tmpJ%2Brsm610maZpaGemXw%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 DashJ - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
