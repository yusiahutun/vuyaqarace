You never know with horses where they can go until you stretch them, so we'll head towards the Derby and we'll see.'</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">And Cruz is convinced the gelding wants further than yesterday's 1,600m trip.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">'He is running well at 1,600m but I really feel he isn't a 1,600m horse,' the trainer said.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">'He is looking more dour at the mile now and he really wants 1,800m or 2,000m.'</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Coetzee had similar thoughts, saying Happee Owner is switching off completely in his races now.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">'I was a bit disappointed with him when he was beaten in the 1,800m at Happy Valley, but there's no doubt he switches off like a horse who wants ground,' he said.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">'Today I had to keep at him a little bit during the race just so he kept his position. His rating will be over 100 now, so he will get a run in any of these races and I think you just have to try him.'</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">And both men's faces lit up when they talked about their other winner, Floral Pegasus, even though any thoughts of big races are quite a way off yet for him.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">His instant gate speed took Floral Pegasus straight to the front without effort going to 1,400m for the first time, and the colt never looked in doubt in taking his third win on end from only four starts.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">'In his work, he's been letting me know that he wanted further than 1,200m and that he would settle and he relaxed wonderfully today,' Coetzee said. 'I was very conscious of not wanting to go too fast on him, but he got to the lead so effortlessly that he probably was going to settle better at 1,400m than in a shorter race where I might have had to just chase him a little to get there.'</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Cruz said the young horse was going 'from strength to strength' and he had hopes of Floral Pegasus becoming a high class miler down the track.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">'He's run a fast time today over 1,400m and I believe he will get further later,' he said. 'He has all that speed - you can do whatever you want with him in a race. For now, he's just going to keep racing his way through his classes but he is quite an exciting horse.'</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Coetzee said one of the things he liked about Floral Pegasus was how naturally racing comes to the good looking colt. 'When he worked the other morning, he was terrific and ran a fantastic time and he didn't turn a hair - he wanted to have a buck when he was pulling up,' the jockey said.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">'Even today, going on to the track and around at the gates, he wanted to buck and play. It isn't nerves, like it is with some horses who wear themselves out before they run, he's just feeling that well. It takes nothing out of him that might stop him racing to his potential, he's just enjoying himself,' the South African added.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tK%2FMqWWcp51krrPAyJyjnmdlaIBxf5NomqutqmKyurHSZpqlmaOotqR5x5qnqZ2VYry4usSr</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 DashJ - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
