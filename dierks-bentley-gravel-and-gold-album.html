The singer explains why in a teaser video for the project that he posted to his social channels.</p><p>"It's been a long road. A 20-year journey filled with highs and lows, twists and turns," he explains, over a montage of performances from over the years. "My love for country music: That's what's always kept me going, town to town, show to show, small clubs to packed arenas. I worked hard. I took chances, went for things. The journey isn't where I've been, it's what I carry with me, into my 10th album."</p><p>With all that history and momentum behind him, Bentley had a specific vision that he wanted to achieve with his new body of work — and he wasn't going to settle for anything less. "I wrote, I recorded, it wasn't good enough. I threw it out and started over, twice. I had to get it right," he continues. "For the fans, and for me, it had to be the best country music I've ever made."</p><p>The album trailer video also shows glimpses of the many people who helped Bentley bring his vision to life, including talented collaborators like <a href=#>Vince Gill</a> and <a href=#>Charlie Worsham</a>. The result, he explains, is a career-encompassing batch of music that sums up his journey to date.</p><p>See the full track list below.</p><figure class="img-tag has-sizer aligncenter" readability=2><p><span class=visually-hidden>attachment-bentley gravel and gold</span></p>UMG Nashville<p>loading...</p></figure><p>"It's the love, the lessons, the gravel and gold," Bentley concludes.</p><p>The title track also has some common themes with Bentley's latest single, "Gold," which is its lead single.</p><h3>Dierks Bentley, Gravel & Gold Track List:</h3><p>1. “Same Ol’ Me”<br>2. “Sun Sets In Colorado”<br>3. “Heartbreak Drinking Tour”<br>4. “Something Real”<br>5. “Still”<br>6. “Beer At My Funeral”<br>7. “Cowboy Boots” (Feat.
