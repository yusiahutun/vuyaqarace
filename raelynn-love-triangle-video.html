The day we wrote this song I almost canceled&nbsp;because my parents were bickering and I was pulled into the middle of it and I was upset. But I’m so glad I went because we created something magical that day."</p><p>"Jimmy and Nicolle shared their stories too — we all come from different triangles, I guess you could say," she adds. "It’s a powerful thing when a song raises its hand four years after you’ve written it … you know it’s special. I still cry every time I hear it. It’s my favorite song I’ve ever written.”</p><p>"When you're a kid of divorce, that is your life," RaeLynn tells <a href=#>People</a>. "You have two beds, you have two separate lives. The whole point of family is to be a unit and to do a lot of things together and it's just not that when your parents are divorced. I think there's been a lot of divorce songs out there, but they've always been about the parents. They've never been from the kid's perspective."</p><p>"Love Triangle" is the latest single off RaeLynn's forthcoming first album with Warner Music Nashville.</p><p><strong>RaeLynn On How Her Parents Took "Love Triangle"</strong></p><p><strong>See Pics of RaeLynn on Tour With Miranda Lambert</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskajBprvFnKaupqSnxm%2BvzqZmq5mVocavuoylpq%2BdXam%2Fqq3NoKOeZaaesaa7jg%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 DashJ - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
