He told police that he felt suffocated and wanted to get off the plane.<p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">None of the 194 passengers aboard were injured in the incident but 12 passengers were taken to a hospital due to breathing difficulties.

In it, a female attendant was seen blocking the emergency exit to prevent passengers from disembarking through the unsecured exit.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The photo triggered reactions online with some saying that the skirts worn by airline staff as uniforms are uncomfortable and unfit for the safety tasks cabin crew members are assigned.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The Aviation Safety Act defines cabin crew as “those who board an aircraft and perform duties for the safety of passengers, such as emergency aircraft evacuation.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">It has been customary for airline companies to provide skirts as uniforms for female cabin crew members. Recently some airlines have begun offering trousers and allow female attendants to choose, but still, a majority of women flight attendants wear skirts.</p><img data-qa=BaseImage-handleRenderImage-StyledImage src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/styles/wide_landscape/public/d8/video/thumbnail/2023/05/26/Clean_0.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p data-qa=SCMPYoutubeVideoPreview-PreviewDuration class="css-dkee4u eaw92su1">01:43</p><p data-qa=SCMPYoutubeVideoPreview-PreviewTitle class="css-1ajvbe4 eaw92su2">Aeroplane door opens mid-flight aboard South Korean Asiana jet</p><p>Aeroplane door opens mid-flight aboard South Korean Asiana jet</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“This makes me question whether or not skirts and heels are appropriate uniforms. Considering that they [cabin crew] are responsible for handling and commanding these types of incidents, wouldn’t trousers and sneakers be more appropriate for what they do?” an online user wrote, while another commented, “No safety guard (other than female flight attendant) wears a skirt.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">This is not the first time flight attendants’ uniforms have been criticised for being impractical.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">In February 2013, the National Human Rights Commission of Korea recommended Asiana Airlines allow its female employees to choose to wear pants. Until that time, the airline required all staff identifying themselves as female to wear skirts.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The watchdog said at the time that restricting female cabin crew from wearing trousers and regulating their appearances in such a manner is sexual discrimination against women, because it’s based on the assumption that women should still in some way have to consider the issue of beauty while working in the service sector.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">A decade has passed, but the outdated practices of airlines and the service sector seem to remain, as several female cabin crew members testified that they are hesitant to wear trousers at work.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-TitleText class="css-66qo9a eeeqn932">‘I thought the plane was going to explode’: passenger opens door mid-air</span></p></a></h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">A flight attendant working at a Korean airline company told The Korea Times under the condition of anonymity that the uniforms “sometimes feel so tight that it’s difficult to move around.” She argued that some female attendants hesitate to request trousers uniforms because the company atmosphere still discourages women from wearing trousers.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">However, airlines argue that flight attendants can freely choose what they wish to wear.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“Flight attendants can request whichever uniform they want, it’s their personal choice,” an official from Asiana told The Korea Times. The company sees both uniforms of skirts and trousers equally and cannot force female attendants to wear one type of uniform or another, because it’s in the realm of the employees’ autonomy,” she said.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The proportion of female staff requesting trousers and skirts was not available, the official said.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tK%2FMqWWcp51ku6bD0miYrKGRZLKiv9NmmKyhkWSus8DInKOeZ2Nnf3ODkWpmmquZlruiecWloKCgpGKutcDEp5uapqSoerTA0a6eoKSVYrG2vsinnmacn6S%2FbrvPnqVmoZ6YtqWxza1krKiRp7i0ecKao6WrXai8tsDHZqKoqpWWeqW105yfZqubnr%2B1vw%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 DashJ - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
