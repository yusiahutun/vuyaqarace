His parents, whom he described as "frugal", didn't want to order delivery and decided to start "foraging around the house for things to eat."</p><p>"There was really nothing in this house except for very basic furniture, some clothes and some edibles and things that I consume recreationally, infrequently," recalled Liu, who added that his mom ended up making her way into the walk-in closet where he kept the edibles at hand.</p><p>"So, she finds what she thinks are gummy bears and trail mix with dried mushrooms inside," Liu told host <a href=#><strong>Jimmy Kimmel</strong></a>. "And she's like, 'Oh, these are snacks.'"</p><p>"So she takes them to my dad and they start popping them like skittles," continued the Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings star, who then described that the pair kept getting hungrier the more they ate, while also feeling like they're "gonna die."</p><p>The pair then decided to go get groceries to satisfy their munchies, which ended in disaster.</p><p>"They get into my car, immediately crash it!" said Liu, who said they crashed into some shrubbery in his driveway. "They're so high at this point, they're freaking out, they don't know what else to do, they knock on my neighbor's door."</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:dbe0042f-075b-4298-9c88-c6f734ce5f59 data-container-ref=toofab:article:893eae8a-44a6-40a4-86d5-055792d2cd61 data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=27><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/a7/5by4/2023/07/26/a7f9df6595b54589b44fae3e51cb8972_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">Twitter</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">Barbie's Simu Liu Addresses That Ryan Gosling Video After Going Viral</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><p>The neighbor then got "roped into it" and helped his parents drive the car back up the driveway while his parents are "freaking out."</p><p>"So, I get home many days later and the car is totaled, my shrubs are wrecked and my drugs are gone," he concluded.
