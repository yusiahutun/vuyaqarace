Some 30-plus years ago, hair was big, curly, crimped, and a major statement maker. As hairstylist Tina Malhotra shares, the '80s were a period where you could have fun trying new hairstyles without judgment: "Mullets, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>pixie haircuts</a>, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>perms</a>, heavy bangs and more are making a comeback."</p><h3 class=mntl-sc-block-universal-callout__heading>Meet the expert</h3><ul><li><a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Tina Malhotra</a> is a hairstylist and colorist based in New York City.</li></ul><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Whether worn long and feathered or short and choppy, many elements of an '80s haircut are re-emerging. But today's modern approach to these styles is much more wearable for everyday and less eccentric while still paying homage to the decade where these hairstyles were born." For example, she says the classic '80s mullet has been reimagined into today's "<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>wolf cut</a>" or shag, giving <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>the mullet</a> a less polarizing choppy look with softer layers.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_4-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Inspiration photos are a must, and these 23 will help you communicate with your stylist the exact shape and length you’re looking for.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-feathery-layers-kim-kardashian></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_5-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-list-item-title"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Feathery Layers: Kim Kardashian</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_6-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Getty Images</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_7-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Kim's style is a fresh spin on the heavily feathered layers of the popular '80s haircut. Syphrett says her hair features ample volume and a curtain bang, which make this feathery layered cut a popular trend. "Set the hair with a round brush or use rollers to create this style. Just make sure to prep the hair with a lot of mousse and volumizing spray, and always finish it with a strong hold hairspray like <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>L'Oréal Professionnel Tecni.Art Extreme Lacquer Hairspray</a> ($28).”</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-the-soft-short-bob-jennifer-lawerence></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_8-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-list-item-title"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>The Soft, Short Bob: Jennifer Lawerence</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_9-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Getty Images</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_10-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">According to Malhotra, Jennifer's cut is a twist on the modern bob with a shattered foundation. “The bob will always remain a classic, but Jennifer wears it in a fresh new way by incorporating her natural wavy texture, which adds volume and shape without needing too many other styling products besides a simple curl cream.”</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-the-soft-short-bob-rose-byrne></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_11-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-list-item-title"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>The Soft, Short Bob: Rose Byrne</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_12-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner readability=27><p>Astrid Stawiarz/Getty Images</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_13-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Nyree Syphrett, master hairstylist at<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1> Warren Tricomi</a> NYC, says soft, short bobs are reminiscent of the hair of Kim Bassinger and Sarah Jessica Parker when full, voluminous, wavy curls were all the rage. “This style has the freedom of wash-and-go and minimal work. With the new generation of this cut, soft, larger waves are styled throughout the hair.”</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-the-soft-short-bob-lily-james></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_14-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-list-item-title"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>The Soft, Short Bob: Lily James</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_15-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Kevin Mazur/Getty Images</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_16-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Lily’s short, sleek cut is a modern take on the sophisticated bobs of the ‘80s. Celebrity stylist Justin Toves-Vincilione, advocate of <a href=# data-component=amazon data-source=affiliate data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>Authentic Beauty Concept</a>, says her layers live mainly around her face and are sculpted into a long curtain effect.

"The modern version is a beautiful play on choppy layers, texture, body, and edge, yet it still really portrays the essence of the 'wild' side of the '80s," Syphrett says. "This cut is great for all hair textures and can easily be styled by applying a thickening product such as <a href=# data-component=amazon data-source=affiliate data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>Milbon Creative Style Volume Thickening Mist 4</a> ($46) and <a href=# data-component=amazon data-source=affiliate data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel=nofollow>Warren Tricomi Molding Clay</a> on the ends after blow drying the hair to achieve added texture."</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-high-top-fade></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_21-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-list-item-title"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>High-Top Fade</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_22-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Getty Images</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_23-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Jodie Turner-Smith’s '80s-inspired high-top fade is the epitome of the throwback style.

To enhance natural curls, apply a bit of hair pomade for added definition.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-full-bouncy-waves-jennifer-lopez></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_24-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-list-item-title"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Full, Bouncy Waves: Jennifer Lopez</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_25-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner readability=27><p>Phillip Faraone/Getty Images</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_26-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">‘80s haircuts were big and full of volume and movement.

"The large waves on long, long layers, with face-framing pieces, are a look many of my clients love and ask for. You'll need a 1.5 to 2-inch curling iron to create the curls, which you should brush out immediately into soft waves."</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-full-bouncy-waves-brooks-nader></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_30-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-list-item-title"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Full, Bouncy Waves: Brooks Nader</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_31-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Getty Images</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_32-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Reminiscent of the long layers and big bouncy blowouts of the '80s, Malhotra says Brooks' curls are bigger and less tight than the curls were years ago. "It's easy to get big, fluffy curls by using hot rollers or a thermal brush like the<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow> Amika Blowout Babe</a> ($100) on already dried hair," she says. "Brush it through the hair and hold the curls briefly. When you finish the whole head, flip it upside down and brush through the curls with a paddle brush."</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-classic-mullet-rihanna></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_33-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-list-item-title"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Classic Mullet: Rihanna</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_34-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Getty Images</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_35-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Rihanna’s mullet is clean and well-coiffed but veers on the choppier side, making it a micro-mullet style with features of a pixie cut. This style is voluminous throughout, with just enough height at the center of the head and a short, side-swept bang to complement it.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-the-shag-selena-gomez></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_36-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-list-item-title"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>The Shag: Selena Gomez</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_38-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Toves-Vincilione says the shag haircut, as seen on Selena, is all about volume and layers. "There are multiple ways to style and wear a shag," he shares. "Focus on volume and bed-head texture for the ultimate '80s throwback." To create a sexy shag like Selena’s, Toves-Vincilione recommends applying mousse to wet hair and air or blow drying it. "If possible, work with any natural waves or textures that are present. Then, once the hair is completely dry, use a hot tool on low heat to encourage the hair to curl or flip out without closing the cuticle or flattening the overall style. Finish off with a texture spray to complete the look."</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-the-shag-nicole-scherzinger></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_39-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-list-item-title"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>The Shag: Nicole Scherzinger</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_41-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">According to Malhotra, Nicole pulls off an '80s style mullet that has been modernized into a shag haircut.

"The hair needs to have a lot of blended layers, especially around the face, and pieced-out texture. Even though the final result is sleek and textured, apply a texture balm or paste, such as <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>IGK Hair Beach Club Paste Soft Texture Paste</a> ($15) to clean, towel-dried hair, and then blow dry the hair to create a pliable foundation. Use your hands to direct the hair forward on the face and create texture. Finally, apply a shaping cream like <a href=# class=pseudoStyle data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel=nofollow>Authentic Beauty Concept Shaping Cream</a> ($28) to add definition and shine without disrupting the grungy finish."</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-the-wet-look-olivia-palermo></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_45-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-list-item-title"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>The Wet Look: Olivia Palermo</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_46-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner readability=27><p>Valentina Frugiuele/Getty Images</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_47-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">As sleek and sophisticated as this slicked-back look is, Syphrett says it was inspired by a men's hairstyle from the '80s. "To create this fierce look, I find that a combination of 60% wet hair and <a href=# data-component=amazon data-source=affiliate data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>Fantasia Liquid Mousse Spray</a> ($16) works wonders."</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-curly-fringe-zendaya></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_48-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-list-item-title"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Curly Fringe: Zendaya</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_49-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Getty Images</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_50-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Hair chameleon Zendaya sports a curly fringe cut with a heavy bang. If you don't have natural curls, wrap pieces of hair around a large-barrel curling iron and, once cool, comb through them. But if your hair doesn’t hold a curl well (or at all), a modern all-over perm can create plush curls, too.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-dramatic-bangs-taylor-swift></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_52-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-list-item-title"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Dramatic Bangs: Taylor Swift</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_53-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner readability=27><p>Jeff Kravitz/Getty Images</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_54-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In the '80s, bangs were either heavy across the forehead or plastered sky-high. Today's interpretation has everything to do with hair texture. "Taylor flaunts a modern bang that's polished, sleek, and most importantly customized to suit her face shape, hairline, and hair texture," Syphrett says. "A simple round brush or flat iron can create the perfect bang style like this."</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-dramatic-bangs-billie-eilish></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_55-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-list-item-title"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Dramatic Bangs: Billie Eilish</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_56-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner readability=27><p>Albert L.

Pairing a sleek, long haircut with a thick fringe bang is a look that she says will continue to play out this fall and winter. “I love that we are embracing bangs again, and I think Billie’s look is so chic. This style looks best on fine to medium naturally straight hair because it’s more of a wash-and-go look with minimal styling required.” To get the bangs straight, Malhotra recommends using a blow dryer from above to blow the roots down and in every direction to break up any natural cowlicks without a brush.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-short-piecey-layers-jourdan-dunn></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_58-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-list-item-title"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Short, Piecey Layers: Jourdan Dunn</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_59-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner readability=27><p>Darren Gerrish/Getty Images</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_60-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">For a short, wavy style, embrace the hair's natural texture, as Jourdan does, or turn up the curl factor with hot rollers for added volume.

You don’t need to chop your hair into super short layers, but make sure they are at a length you’re comfortable with. After blow drying the hair, use volumizing mousse to prep the hair and then a small round brush to curl each section. For highly textured hair, pre-stretch the hair first and then go in to complete the blowout curls. A large curling iron may help make this process easier post-pre-stretch.
