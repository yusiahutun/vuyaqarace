It’s a good time to think of the world’s second-most precious asset.</span></p><p type=p><span type=text>Water is vital to almost all living things, yet in Hong Kong we take it for granted. It’s easy to turn on a tap and have water come out. If we don’t want to boil and cool it, or we think other water is better to drink, we can buy some, wrapped in plastic and shipped halfway around the world to be on our supermarket shelves.</span></p><p type=p><span type=text>In many other countries, though, that’s just not the case. In many places around the world, there is just not enough water to grow enough food for the people who need it. Millions of people don’t have access to clean drinking water.</span></p><p class="BodyParagraph__StyledBlockElement-sc-4sxwoh-0 hVXIcN Body__StyledBodyParagraph-sc-1cgoct-1 UAQBx" type=p><span itemprop="associatedMedia image" class="BodyImage__StyledFigure-sc-19n75h5-0 eCNFdy speech-skip-target" itemtype=http://schema.org/ImageObject><span></span><span class="BodyImage__StyledFigCaption-sc-19n75h5-2 fcoAVE">Water is life!</span></span></p><p class="BodyParagraph__StyledBlockElement-sc-4sxwoh-0 hVXIcN Body__StyledBodyParagraph-sc-1cgoct-1 UAQBx" type=p><span type=text>The story I’m going to share with you is not that serious, thankfully.</span></p><p class="BodyParagraph__StyledBlockElement-sc-4sxwoh-0 hVXIcN Body__StyledBodyParagraph-sc-1cgoct-1 UAQBx" type=p><span type=text>Just recently, my sister and her family were having a terrible time in Cape Town, in South Africa, starting in 2015.</span></p><p class="BodyParagraph__StyledBlockElement-sc-4sxwoh-0 hVXIcN Body__StyledBodyParagraph-sc-1cgoct-1 UAQBx" type=p><span type=text>South Africa, the country that’s, well, the southernmost in Africa, is very dry. Not all of it, but most of it. Other parts are quite tropical. Cape Town can be a bit bare in winter but is quite lush in summer.</span></p><p class="BodyParagraph__StyledBlockElement-sc-4sxwoh-0 hVXIcN Body__StyledBodyParagraph-sc-1cgoct-1 UAQBx" type=p><span type=text>For years, the South African government had not upgraded the water system and dams. For years, people had flocked to the city, or were already there and just wanted to have running water. Many people outside of cities have to fetch it in great big buckets from a single tap shared by many families.</span></p><p class="BodyParagraph__StyledBlockElement-sc-4sxwoh-0 hVXIcN Body__StyledBodyParagraph-sc-1cgoct-1 UAQBx" type=p><strong type=strong><a href=# class="BodyLink__StyledLink-sc-1uefa8x-0 cJwLWs"><span type=text>Water idioms to freshen up your writing</span></a></strong></p><p class="BodyParagraph__StyledBlockElement-sc-4sxwoh-0 hVXIcN Body__StyledBodyParagraph-sc-1cgoct-1 UAQBx" type=p><span type=text>So, when the winter rains faltered in South Africa, and the level of water in the dams did not rise as expected, water was rationed. People were not allowed to water their gardens, wash their cars, or top up their swimming pools at first.</span></p><p class="BodyParagraph__StyledBlockElement-sc-4sxwoh-0 hVXIcN Body__StyledBodyParagraph-sc-1cgoct-1 UAQBx" type=p><span type=text>Many people ignored the warnings.</span></p><p class="BodyParagraph__StyledBlockElement-sc-4sxwoh-0 hVXIcN Body__StyledBodyParagraph-sc-1cgoct-1 UAQBx" type=p><span type=text>Others, like my sister, used her dishwashing water to carefully water the few tomato plants she was nurturing in yogurt containers. It was too hot and dry to leave them in the garden.</span></p><p class="BodyParagraph__StyledBlockElement-sc-4sxwoh-0 hVXIcN Body__StyledBodyParagraph-sc-1cgoct-1 UAQBx" type=p><span type=text>The next year, those winter rains were, again, just not enough.

People were encouraged to flush only if they had done a poo, with the slogan we had seen before: “If it’s yellow, let it mellow, if it’s brown, flush it down”.</span></p><p class="BodyParagraph__StyledBlockElement-sc-4sxwoh-0 hVXIcN Body__StyledBodyParagraph-sc-1cgoct-1 UAQBx" type=p><span type=text>Those who could, put wells in their gardens to tap the water underground. Showers – not baths – were quick as lightning. Many days people skipped them completely because there just wasn’t enough water to go around.</span></p><p class="BodyParagraph__StyledBlockElement-sc-4sxwoh-0 hVXIcN Body__StyledBodyParagraph-sc-1cgoct-1 UAQBx" type=p><span type=text>Clothes could only be washed sparingly, so lots of people were happy to wear garments that passed the “sniff” test. And when clothes were washed, that water was carefully collected and used to flush the toilet.</span></p><p class="BodyParagraph__StyledBlockElement-sc-4sxwoh-0 hVXIcN Body__StyledBodyParagraph-sc-1cgoct-1 UAQBx" type=p><span type=text>It seemed to go on forever. Each day my family anxiously scanned the skies, buckets ready in case the slightest little shower should pass.

The economy, too was hurting. Kind of like in this pandemic, people lost jobs. Day Zero was drawing ever nearer.
