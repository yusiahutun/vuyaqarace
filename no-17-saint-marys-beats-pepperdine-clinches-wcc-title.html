The Gaels shot 59.6 percent from the field, had a 37-24 rebounding edge and led by as many as 27 points while beating the Waves for the 15th time in the past 17 meetings. Saint Mary's, which will be the No. 1 seed for the upcoming WCC tournament, closes the regular season at home against No. 23 Gonzaga on Saturday night.
