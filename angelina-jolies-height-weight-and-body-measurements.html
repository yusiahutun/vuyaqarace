Her name should not be unknown to anyone who has access to any kind of media especially lately with even CNN carrying the news of her ongoing divorce. Make no mistake <a href=#>Angelina Jolie</a> casts a bigger shadow than her separation from Brad Pitt.</p><p>Her work as an actress filmmaker and humanist has set her apart from others and made Angelina Jolie’s career a very praiseworthy climax. Today it’s mainly about Angelina Jolie’s height weight and body measurements and not about her private life but when it shows up somewhere you just know that we couldn’t help it.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Angelina Jolie’s Height</strong></h2><p>The actress is not freaky tall but she is far above the average height of a woman at 5 feet 7 inches. Other celebrities who share Angelina Jolie’s height are Kurt Cobain, Tom Cruise, and Justin Bieber. Just like all the other celebrities out there speculations have arisen as to whether the star is actually that big.</p><p>Unlike our basketball players out there who are aiming to reduce their height, Jolie seems to have added a few extra inches. Fans and haters have taken the time to dig up images of the star with people revealing their “true greatness”.</p><p><strong>ALSO READ: <a href=#>Lady Gaga’s Height, Weight And Body Measurements</a></strong></p><p>This fan’s observation about the height of a particular actress is interesting, as it appears that she may be taller than her reported 173 cm. Furthermore, this fan noted that even when wearing 6-8 cm boot heels and standing next to someone who was supposedly 165 cm tall, the actress appeared relatively tall in comparison. This suggests that the true height of this individual may not have been accurately reported.</p><p>Another wrote ‘In the VF interview she said it was one of the problems with her character. She was supposed to do all these fights and she was so much tinier than everyone else on the set and they had to somehow make it look believable that someone so tiny could be so tough. 5’1″ is probably about right.’</p><p>We have to give the crown to the person who said that: &nbsp;‘Good lord, not the height debate again?!!? IT DOESN’T MATTER who is taller or shorter than anyone else. DOESN’T MATTER!! I don’t care if Jen is taller or shorter than Angelina (cause you to know that’s where this discussion is going to lead) – and I don’t care if either of them is 5’1″ or 5’7.’</p><p>If the lady says she’s 5 feet 7 inches let’s do it until she says something else and that’s all we have at Angelina Jolie’s height.</p><p><strong>ALSO READ: <a href=#>Megan Fox Height, Weight And Body Measurements</a></strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Angelina Jolie’s Weight</strong></h2><p>Forget the whole fuss about Angelina Jolie’s height the weight of the actress has been a cause for concern for some time now and it is all the more amid her divorce. As early as 2014 when her weight loss took a drastic turn it turned out that the actress lost weight to show solidarity with the actors who were forced to become slim for her World War II film Unbroken.</p><p>In the same year, she underwent a preventive double mastectomy because she did not want her children to lose her to cancer just as she lost her mother Marcheline Bertrand to the disease. However, her weight continued to decline.</p><p>The actress was already underweight at 52 kg but in the midst of her ongoing divorce, she is getting worse and worse. When the divorce was still a rumor Jolie’s weight loss caused John Voight her father with whom she had a long-standing feud to reach her in concern. At that time experts said that she weighed 35 kg every father would be worried.</p><p>Angelina and her father have been fighting since 2002 when Voight Jolie called them “serious mental problems. More recently as the divorce is no longer a rumor the actress can weigh a little more with 40 kg but she is still very unhealthy. Apparently, she doesn’t get along well with the divorce and has to be reminded to eat.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebily.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Angelina-jolie-skinny.jpg><p>Hopefully, she will calm down and try to build up her weight it would be a shame if she took the trouble to do a double mastectomy to stay alive for her children only to die of hunger in the end.</p><p><strong>ALSO READ: <a href=#>Blake Lively’s Height, Weight And Body Measurements</a></strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Angelina Jolie’s Body Measurements</strong></h2><p>In addition to Angelina Jolie’s size and weight loss here are some of her other body measurements for you.
