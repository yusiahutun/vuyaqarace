Mitchell Airport in Bequia and was traveling to St. Lucia, about 65 miles away. However, it crashed into the sea about a mile off the coast of Petit Nevis sometime after midday. Authorities said moments after taking off, it “experienced difficulties and plummeted into the ocean.”</p><p>“Shortly after takeoff, the aircraft experienced difficulties and nose-dived into the ocean,” the Royal St. Vincent and the Grenadines Police Force said in a statement to media outlets. “Fishermen and divers from Paget Farm went to the incident scene in their boats to render assistance.” All four bodies have been recovered, officials said.</p><p>The cause of the crash remains under investigation. According to local reports, the pilot radioed the tower shortly after takeoff, reporting he was experiencing trouble and was turning back. That was the last communication from the plane.</p><p>Oliver, born in Germany and best known for the 2008 film Speed Racer, posted on New Year’s Day that he and his family were “somewhere in paradise.” Other film credits include The Good German, Alarm for Cobra 11, Saved by the Bell: The New Class, Indiana Jones, and the Dial of Destiny. He recently wrapped up the Nick Lyon-directed movie Forever Hold Your Peace on December 20.</p><p>On Friday, an emotional statement “from Jessica Klepser and family” was posted on Wundabar Pilates’ social media page by Amy Jordan, the company’s owner. Klepser, who was married to Oliver, is the regional manager of the California branch of the Pilates studio, according to the image included in the post.</p><p>“We are deeply saddened by the tragic plane accident on January 4, 2024, which took the lives of our beloved family members. Our daughters, Madita (12) and Annik (10), along with their father, Christian, were returning from a holiday in the Caribbean when the single-engine plane they were traveling in experienced engine trouble and fell into the ocean. Unfortunately, all four passengers on the small aircraft did not survive.</p><p>“Madita, a vibrant 7th-grade student at Louis Armstrong Middle School, was known for her lively spirit and excelled in academics, dance, singing, and performances. Annik, a 4th-grade student at Wonderland Ave Elementary School, was recognized for her gentle yet strong demeanor. She was always the first to offer a kind word or a comforting hug. Her passions included basketball, swimming, and various forms of art,” the post continued.</p><p>“The deep bond, infectious laughter, and adventurous spirit shared by Madita and Annik will be profoundly missed in their communities. Their devoted mother, Jessica Klepser, in LA, survives the girls. They also leave behind their grandparents, several aunts, uncles, and cousins in Germany.”</p><p>“Christian, an actor in Europe and the US and a real estate agent with a broad network of close friends worldwide, is survived by Jessica, his parents, and a sister in Germany. His loss will be deeply felt by all who knew him.” The statement concluded by asking for privacy for the family “at this difficult time.”</p><p>A link to a <a href=#><span>GoFundMe</span></a> page set up for the family by a friend of Klepser named Sarah Silverman was also shared for donations in lieu of flowers.</p><p>“Your donations will help cover the cost of returning Christian and the girls home, funeral and memorial services, legal expenses, and will go a long way in support of Jessica and the extended family during this terribly difficult time,” a post on the page read.</p><p>The actor and his daughters are survived by his wife, Klepser. To date, the GoFundMe page has surpassed the $100,000 goal and sits at $162,993 raised.</p><span itemscope itemtype=http://schema.org/Article class=itempropwp-wrap><span itemprop=image itemscope itemtype=https://schema.org/ImageObject></span></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo77IrbCam5OawLR6wqikaGpgZ4FwfJBoZ3Fnppa5rMXRopxmmZOpvLN5wqGpoquknq6vec6loK%2BdomKur7CMra6oZZSWwqi0056prGWbnrmtscNmoKdloKGur7GMnKmaq5hk</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 DashJ - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
