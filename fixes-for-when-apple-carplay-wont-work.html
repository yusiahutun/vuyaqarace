But, like anything in the tech world, Apple CarPlay can malfunction, which is frustrating if you need it for your next quick trip or long ride.</p><p>So, if Apple CarPlay isn't working, how can you get it back up and running again?</p><h2 id=restart-your-phone>1. Restart Your Phone</h2><p>We'll start with the most obvious remedy for many smartphone-related issues: a restart. <a href=#>Restarting your phone can fix various issues</a>, so the easiest initial step to take when Apple CarPlay isn't working is a reboot.</p><h2 id=make-sure-carplay-is-enabled-on-your-iphone>2. Make Sure CarPlay Is Enabled on Your iPhone</h2><p>If you can't get Apple CarPlay started in your vehicle, it might be because the feature has not yet been enabled on your iPhone. To do this, you will need to:</p><li>First, head to your phone's settings, and then head to <strong>General</strong>.</li><li>Then, go to the <strong>CarPlay</strong> section in your General Settings and head to <strong>My Cars</strong>. Here, you can configure or re-configure your vehicle by forgetting it and connecting to it again. If you don't have any cars paired, your phone will scan for nearby cars to locate yours.</li><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/car-play-1.jpeg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/iphone-bluetooth-1.jpg> <span class=txt>Close</span><p>You'll also need to ensure that the vehicle you have configured for CarPlay isn't disabled in <strong>Screen Time</strong>. To check this, head back to your settings and tap on the <strong>Content & Privacy Restrictions</strong> category.</p><p>Here, you'll see a section named <strong>Allowed Apps</strong>. From here, you'll see which apps on your phone have been granted screen permissions. If the toggle is to the left, tap it to activate CarPlay's permissions.</p><h2 id=make-sure-your-bluetooth-is-connected>3. Make Sure Your Bluetooth Is Connected</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/usb-apple-1.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>If you're using Apple CarPlay wirelessly, ensure <a href=#>your iPhone's Bluetooth is enabled</a>. This is the most likely culprit when Apple CarPlay isn't connecting to your iPhone. You can find your Bluetooth settings by heading to <strong>Settings > </strong><strong>Bluetooth</strong>. Here, you can activate Bluetooth using the toggle.</p><p>In this instance, you should also check that Airplane Mode isn't currently enabled on your phone, as this will disable your device's wireless capabilities. As you can see in the screenshot above, the toggle shows that Airplane Mode is deactivated. If this toggle is green, simply tap it once to disable Airplane Mode, so you can connect to your vehicle wirelessly.</p><p>If this fails, consider removing your Bluetooth CarPlay connection entirely and then re-pairing with your car. Sometimes, forgetting a paired device and then pairing it again is enough to fix common Bluetooth issues, so give it a try if disabling and enabling your Bluetooth hasn't worked.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=check-your-usb-cable>4. Check Your USB Cable</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/car-play-1.jpeg><p>If you're using CarPlay via a wired connection, there may be an issue with your Lightning cable. Check to ensure it's intact, and then test it out in another setting. For example, you could try charging or connecting another device using the same cable to see if it works.</p><p>It's often the simplest faults that cause tech issues. If you constantly have problems with your current cable, consider replacing it with one of <a href=#>the best Lightning cables</a> to regain a reliable connection.</p><p>Also, ensure that your USB cable is plugged into the correct port in your vehicle. Your vehicle may have various USB ports, though only one may be appropriate for Apple CarPlay. Test out all your USB ports if you're having an issue connecting.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=regularly-update-your-operating-system>5. Regularly Update Your Operating System</h2><p>Some of the issues you'll encounter when using your smartphone can be solved through a simple software update, making it one of the <a href=#>reasons why you need to update iOS</a> frequently. This can fix any bugs or additional problems affecting your device's performance.</p><p>So, if you're having problems with Apple CarPlay, make sure you're using the latest version of iOS rather than an older version.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/car-play-1.jpeg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src> <span class=txt>Close</span><p>You can check whether your smartphone is due for an update by heading to <strong>Settings > General ></strong><strong>Software Update</strong>. Here, you'll be able to see if a newer version of iOS is available, which could help solve your CarPlay issue.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=make-sure-siri-is-enabled-when-locked>6. Make Sure Siri Is Enabled When Locked</h2><p>If you're trying to control Apple CarPlay using your voice and it isn't responding, this might be because your Siri voice assistant is disabled on your phone whenever it's locked. To check Siri's status, head to <strong>Settings </strong>> <strong>Siri & Search</strong>.</p><span class=txt>Close</span><p>Here, you can check if Siri is active. If it isn't enabled, tap the toggle next to <strong>Allow Siri When Locked</strong> to activate it.</p><h2 id=make-sure-your-vehicle-is-compatible-with-carplay>7. Make Sure Your Vehicle Is Compatible with CarPlay</h2><p>Unfortunately, not all car models and manufacturers support Apple CarPlay. For instance, if your vehicle was built before 2015, it's unlikely that you'll be able to use CarPlay, as the hardware itself isn't designed for such a feature. You can check out our list of <a href=#>all car manufacturers that support CarPlay</a> or head to the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">official Apple list of CarPlay-supported models</a> to see whether your vehicle is compatible with this feature.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=fix-carplay-issues-with-minimal-fuss>Fix CarPlay Issues With Minimal Fuss</h2><p>It's always frustrating when your trusty Apple CarPlay stops working, as being unable to use your phone responsibly on the road can be very limiting.
