No updates have been posted on Alira’s TikTok page since last June, while the sheikh began attending investment forums in Dubai in the third quarter and visited Hong Kong in December.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">His second visit to the city last month included speaking at a session of the Wealth for Good in Hong Kong summit. However, his decision to postpone the launch of his high-profile family office in the city at the last minute sparked questions among some about his commitment to the investment.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Government sources previously said that only “basic” checks were performed before the sheikh’s engagement, as they feared a stringent review might offend the VIP.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-TitleText class="css-66qo9a eeeqn932">Aide to Dubai prince: ‘We are committed to Hong Kong but we do it quietly’</span></p></a></h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The bureau made no mention about the due diligence efforts in its Saturday post, but it reiterated that it was “rare to see such a grand gathering” of high-calibre guests from royal families, international enterprises, financial institutions and philanthropic groups.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">It also said a meeting was held on March 26 between Lee and about 30 speakers and prominent guests “to express the importance attached to the notable guests”. Maktoum was one of them.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The post followed comments by Aaron Shum Wan-lung, founding president of the Hong Kong-Middle East Business Chamber, who told a number of media outlets that the prince might have felt offended after learning of a seemingly “downgrade” of officials attending the now-postponed opening ceremony.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-TitleText class="css-66qo9a eeeqn932">No checks done on Dubai prince before he met Hong Kong’s John Lee</span></p></a></h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">But two government sources said authorities were mindful that sending a high-ranking official to the opening of one particular office might create perception problems for others that they were not receiving equal treatment.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">A source said the latest blog post was meant to put an end to the controversy and it was hoped members of the public would have a better idea on family business offices.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The private office declined to comment on Shum’s remarks.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The bureau also noted that Hong Kong’s low tax regime, political stability and rule of law, would allow family offices to flourish in the city.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tK%2FMqWWcp51ku6bD0mifqKaXYriwusZon6iml2K4sLrGZpycp56kurp7wKuropucmnx0fpRxaGlqX6K2pbDLnmSemaOpeqetzKKjsmWfm7Oqr8SsZJqflaOxonnHqKWgZZuku6h5zp%2BdopuZlrm0ecGuqZ6ZpWLAosXSZq6hoZyaerTAxJ6poqaXYrCtscCrZKadnqm2sLrIp54%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 DashJ - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
