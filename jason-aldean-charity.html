"I got two kids and one on the way ... and&nbsp;I would be devastated if something happened to one of my kids."</p><p>"I can't imagine what parents go through when stuff like that happens," he continues. "I can't think of a better thing to give to and try to support than a children's hospital and if I'm going to do it, I want to do it in my hometown."</p><p><strong>Jason Aldean Reveals One Word That Describes Him in High School</strong></p><p>Aldean's 2017&nbsp;event raised even more money than the first,&nbsp;with Aldean and his efforts bringing more than $1.2 million total (over two years) to the hospital, which provides necessary clinical services to children in need.</p><p>But that only scratches the surface of the superstar's benevolent efforts. Aldean has developed&nbsp;a longtime partnership with cancer organization Susan G. Komen,&nbsp;and at every show during his tour, the star&nbsp;invites a breast cancer survivor to be a VIP guest for the day, allowing them to&nbsp;hang out backstage, get a behind-the-scenes look at the tour and even eat dinner with Aldean and crew.</p><p>"You meet a lot of great people and hear a lot of great stories," the "They Don't Know" singer says about engaging with those battling the&nbsp;disease. "It's just cool to even be able to sort of roll out the red carpet for them for a day and let them have a great time. I really enjoy that a lot."</p><p><strong>Country Singers Who've Been Directly Affected by Cancer</strong></p><a class="next-post cto" href=#>Next: Jason Aldean Reveals His Son's Name</a><p><strong>We Promise You’ve Never Seen a Cover Quite Like This!</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskajBprvFnKaupqSnxm%2BvzqZmo5mjpLturcudnJqmXZi1or7IrbBo</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 DashJ - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
