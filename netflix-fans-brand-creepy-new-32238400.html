The programme follows the story of one of the UK's most prolific cyberstalkers and the victims who he taunted over an 11-year period.</p><p>The culprit behind the heinous crimes was Matthew Hardy, who taunted at least 62 different women across the UK.

Hardy went as far as causing rifts in relationships as he would pose as the victim and send sexually explicit messages to the victims' friends and family members.</p><p>The crazy cyber behaviour didn't just stop online. Hardy caused some his victims' anxieties to hit the roof as he also physically stalked them too.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i2-prod.dailystar.co.uk/incoming/article32224792.ece/ALTERNATES/s458/0_Netflix-star-signs-huge-deal-for-CBB-after-receiving-life-changing-diagnosis.jpg><p>In the Netflix documentary which illustrated Hardy's crimes, a creepy voice was used when the messages that Hardy sent was read out. The dark programme led many viewers to speak out online as they shared how petrified the true crime series made them feel.</p><p>Heading over to social media platform X, one fan said: "Watching Can I Tell You A Secret? on Netflix and the voices they use to read the messages are freaking me out." Another penned: "Can I Tell You A Secret? on Netflix is perfect nightmare fuel, especially if you’re a woman, and what did I, a woman, do? I watched it right before bed."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/s2-prod.mirror.co.uk/@trinitymirrordigital/chameleon-branding/publications/dailystar/img/logo-schema-dailystar.png><p>While a third shared: "Can I Tell You A Secret? on Netflix I can say is one of the craziest and scariest documentary I’ve watched. It’s literally about stalkers and their victims, I recommend y’all to watch especially women."</p><p>Hardy was finally convicted for his crimes in 2022. He was sentenced to nine years in prison after he pleaded guilty to three counts of stalking with intent to cause alarm or distress, two counts of stalking without intent to cause alarm, and also breaching a restraining order that was made against him from 2013.</p><p><b><i>For more of the latest showbiz news from Daily Star, make sure you sign up to one of our newsletters </i></b><a data-content-type=section data-link-tracking=InArticle|Link href=#><b><i>here</i></b></a>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pa3IpbCsrJGne6S7ja6iaKymZLumwMWloLFllpa7tHnBq5innF2Yv6axz7Jkp52nYoBzfpJxa2lo</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 DashJ - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
