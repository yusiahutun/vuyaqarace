Enertia Software’s CUSTOMER SOLUTIONS TEAM<strong>&nbsp;</strong>streamlines its customer support services and improves the overall customer experience.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>An Overview of the IT Industry and its Impact on Oil and Gas</h2><p>In 2021, the oil and gas industry was facing significant challenges due to the COVID-19 pandemic, which caused a decline in demand for oil and gas and led to a decrease in prices. This, in turn, led to a decrease in investment in the industry, including in IT. However, the industry has been gradually recovering as economies reopen and demand for oil and gas increases. One trend that has been emerging in the industry is the increased use of digital technologies, including IT, to improve efficiency, reduce costs, and increase safety.&nbsp;</p><p>Some of the key areas where IT is being used in the oil and gas industry include:</p><ul><li><strong>Data management and analytics</strong>&nbsp;– This includes the use of big data analytics to optimize production and reduce costs, as well as to monitor and manage safety and environmental risks.</li><li><strong>Digital oilfield technologies</strong>&nbsp;– These are technologies that enable remote monitoring and control of oil and gas production facilities, which can improve efficiency and safety.</li><li><strong>Cybersecurity</strong>&nbsp;– With the increased use of digital technologies, cybersecurity has become a critical concern for the industry, and companies are investing in cybersecurity measures to protect their operations.</li><li><strong>Cloud computing&nbsp;</strong>– This technology is being used to improve data access, storage, and processing, which can lead to cost savings and greater efficiency.</li></ul><p>Overall, the oil and gas industry is facing both challenges and opportunities in the current IT landscape, and companies that can effectively leverage technology are likely to be more successful in the long run.</p><p>Enertia Software steps in and provides the network, hardware, IT services, and leading-edge software to maintain integrated data. The ability to outsource IT services through hosting options provide alternative accessibility and cost-saving solutions for upstream oil and gas operators.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Keeping Pace with Industry Changes and Challenges</h2><p>The oil and gas industry is known for its volatile prices, and companies have to manage their operations and investments in the face of constantly changing prices. Oil and gas companies face increasing pressure to reduce their environmental impact and comply with regulations related to emissions, safety, and other environmental concerns. This can result in increased costs and complexity for companies.</p><p>The development of alternative energy sources, such as solar and wind power, is creating competition for traditional fossil fuels. This can lead to reduced demand and lower prices for oil and gas. As the most accessible and easy-to-extract oil and gas reserves have already been exploited, companies face increasing difficulty and expense in accessing new reserves, particularly in remote or challenging locations.&nbsp;</p><p>Of these challenges, where Enertia Software can help the most is the rapid advancement of digital technologies that are transforming the <a href=#>oil and gas industry</a>, and companies that fail to adapt risk falling behind their competitors.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Constantly Staying a Notch Up</h2><p>Enertia Software is constantly being fine-tuned by developers and improved with new updates and enhancements to ensure that it is always up-to-date and provides the most accurate and relevant information to its customers.</p><p>To ensure that its services are up to date with information technology, it undergoes regular training and testing to ensure, understand, and interpret the latest developments and needs of its customers. Its customer engagement team also monitors and analyzes trends accordingly to ensure that Enertia Software is equipped with the latest information.&nbsp;</p><p>All these efforts consider the most important element of its dynamic industry, the customers’ needs and their commitment to ensuring they remain successful and efficient. Incorporating customer feedback allows the company to include a wide range of sources such as industry reports, online forums, its annual user conference, and user group communities.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Sharing is Synonymous with Growing</h2><p>The famous proverb, “Sharing is Caring” teaches us how the art of sharing is an act of care and compassion. Likewise, Vincent is a long-time believer that knowledge sharing is essential. However, what he didn’t suspect at first, was how beneficial it could be to his organization and him. For instance, each year, he met with science and engineering students at his alma mater, North Carolina A&T.</p><p>Vincent is passionate about teaching and sharing his wisdom and experiences with young minds, and in return, he learns quite a bit in the process. It’s a two-way street. He adds, “I tell them what I know, and they tell me what they know — including what they see for the future.</p><p>Launching a mentorship program within our organization. Being a leader humbles you, especially when you take time to think about how far you’ve come amid distractions, downturns, and competition. If you’ve climbed to the top, you’re in a position to throw others a line to join you. That’s a remarkable position to be in — and one you don’t want to take for granted.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Defining a Culture of Diversity, Equality, and Congeniality&nbsp;</h2><p>A huge component of Enertia Software is keeping its culture and company culturally diverse and comfortable.&nbsp;</p><p>It also believes in encouraging professional and personal development – in today’s online and work-from-home environments. The company also encourages its team to take courses, be it for one’s physical /mental and/or professional/personal development, and it thinks the opportunity has proven to provide wonderful results!</p><p>Exposing team members to new ideas and new programs helps them feel refreshed and it also opens their environments to discoveries. It teaches them new perspectives while keeping them aware of the current market and its demand. They often bring that energy and learnings back and share it, and that excitement is truly contagious.&nbsp;</p><p>Challenge your employees with out-of-the-box opportunities. As Enertia makes software, it challenges its employees to set up philanthropic initiatives that the whole team can get involved in; it incentivizes them to come up with new ways to engage with its customers and find new ways to make sure it as a team, stays connected.&nbsp;</p><p>When employees feel like they are part of the organization’s growth, there is a sense of ownership that comes with being a part of the organization’s growth as a whole and that matters. They start thinking as a partner of the company rather than an employee. If people want to be part of success – encourage them to do so.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Vincent’s Piece of Advice to Budding Leaders</h2><p>Today this is how I feel: finding the middle/ don’t get too high or too low; in all things stay consistent in communication and style.&nbsp;</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>The Notable Testimonials</h3><h5 class=wp-block-heading>1.
