We'll wait. Beginning in 2005, the actress and&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>fashion icon</a>&nbsp;(not just anyone can&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=3>pull off socks over sweatpants</a>, alright?) engaged in a whirlwind romance with PDA-filled red carpet appearances that solidified their public image as TomKat. Within a year of meeting, they were engaged and welcomed a child together. A few months later, they tied the knot (Holmes's first marriage and Cruise's third). While many believed that the union wouldn't last — and it ultimately didn't — the pair still went on to share nearly six years together as husband and wife.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Since their 2012 divorce, we're remembering the Hollywood couple that once gave every teenager a glimmer of hope that it was possible — although highly unlikely — that maybe, just maybe, the dream of marrying their celebrity crush could become a reality.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_5-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Here's a look back at Katie Holmes and Tom Cruise's relationship.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-april-2005-tom-cruise-and-katie-holmes-first-meet-and-are-spotted-together></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_7-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>April 2005: Tom Cruise and Katie Holmes first meet and are spotted together</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_8-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Eric VANDEVILLE/Getty Images</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_9-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">As the story goes, after Cruise divorced&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Nicole Kidman</a>&nbsp;and subsequently&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>split from then-girlfriend Penelope Cruz</a>, the&nbsp;Mission: Impossible&nbsp;actor's beloved Church of Scientology set out to find him a worthy (and malleable) wife. After reportedly courting (and ultimately scaring off) famous women like&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=3>Sofía Vergara</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=4>Scarlett Johansson</a>, the task proved more difficult than expected.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_11-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Eventually, church officials' prayers were answered through a&nbsp;Seventeen&nbsp;article,&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>per HuffPost</a>. In October 2004, Holmes (then&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>engaged to Chris Klein</a>) told the teen magazine, "I used to think that I was going to marry Tom Cruise."&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_15-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Six months later, Klein and Holmes announced their breakup, and on April 27, 2005, Cruise and Holmes were first spotted together in Rome. TomKat made their red carpet debut as a couple two days later on April 29 at the David di Donatello Awards. Coincidence?

Their wedding was marked by an extravagant ceremony and reception at an Italian castle that cost more than $3 million, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>according to E!

Although the&nbsp;Top Gun&nbsp;star admitted that he "didn't expect" the divorce —&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>per CBS News</a>&nbsp;— the legal proceedings ran smoothly, and a settlement was reached in just 11 days.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_49-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Cruise and Holmes have rarely spoken on the record in regard to their split, but it's rumored that Holmes's motivation was to free her daughter from the unique constraints of Scientology. During his deposition against Bauer Media Cruise (whose tabloids claimed he'd abandoned Suri), Cruise was asked if Holmes left him "in part to protect Suri from Scientology."&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_51-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Insulted, he said, "There is no need to protect my daughter from my religion."&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_53-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">However,&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>according to ABC News</a>, when prodded again, specifically as to whether Holmes had mentioned that she was leaving in an effort to protect Suri from Scientology, Cruise responded, "Did she say that? That was one of the assertions, yes."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_55-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Holmes was granted primary custody of Suri in their divorce. Though Cruise was afforded ample visitation, it was widely reported that he rarely saw his daughter.
