While playing rocker Tommy Lee, the special makeup department had to make sure the false penis looked as real as the one the star himself posted on social media.</p><p><b>READ MORE: </b><b><a data-content-type=news data-link-tracking=InArticle|Link href=# rel=follow>Hollywood star contracted gonorrhoea from real sex scene – and used payout to fund movie</a></b></p><p><b>READ MORE: Click for more brilliant</b><a data-content-type=section data-link-tracking=InArticle|Link href=# rel=follow> <b>Daily Star showbiz stories</b></a></p><p>One make-up designer told GQ of the process: “We apply the piece by having the actor saddle himself into the appliance like a sleeve.

In the HBO show, his character Cameron strips off in the bathroom to change into a pair of trunks – baring all.</p><p>He explained to Jimmy Fallon: “You go into these things and you have a conversation with the director and the producers and they go, ‘OK, for this, we’re going to use a prosthetic. We’re going to use something.’ And you say, ‘OK, that sounds good.’</p><p>“I said, ‘Honestly, I just don’t want it to be distracting. He needs to be a regular Joe, because the scene is not about the pee-pee. It’s about the power play and sex. It’s about whether he did it deliberately or whether it was an accident and what that means. She [the makeup designer] says, ‘I got you.’</p><p>“We get to set and she’s got like a hammer or something. It’s bigger than that, it’s like she stole it off a donkey in a field. The thing is ginormous. Me and the director Mike White are sitting there going, ‘Is that average, is it?’ We’re like calling our respective partners, going ‘I’m so sorry.’”</p><p>The member was around “nine inches flaccid and four inches wide” – eek!</p><h3>John Cena</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i2-prod.dailystar.co.uk/incoming/article32286196.ece/ALTERNATES/s458/0_lucym-1.jpg><p>While filming a sex scene with his Trainwreck co-star Amy Schumer, former wrestler John Cena had to go almost full-frontal in the role. He admitted that his “big part”, however, was completely down to the costume department.</p><p>He confessed on Jimmy Kimmel Live: “I was gifted a stunt penis. I had to do a sex scene, which involved me being almost all the way naked. I had to stuff myself in a small nylon sock, and they gave me a stunt penis to insinuate an erection.”</p><p>The WWE star’s member was made of a wooden broom handle fashioned to look like the real thing, with Amy explaining to E! News: “Jimmy was our prop guy and he was whittling one day. I was like, 'What you doing, Jimmy? What you working on?' He was like, 'I'm making John's erection.'"</p><h3>Channing Tatum</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/s2-prod.mirror.co.uk/@trinitymirrordigital/chameleon-branding/publications/dailystar/img/logo-schema-dailystar.png><p>While on set for 2012 romantic movie The Vow, Channing Tatum got a prosthetic peen made up just to spook his co-star Rachel McAdams.</p><p>Rachel confessed to Stella Magazine: “Channing got the props department to make a prosthetic, um, member. Literally a fake penis. I didn’t know what to do – I thought, ‘Is that the real deal?’ It was very realistic. It was ridiculous, the scale of it!”</p><h3>Chris Hemsworth</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i2-prod.dailystar.co.uk/incoming/article32292481.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_67554643-11736715-image-a-2_1676045264085.jpg><p>Thor actor Chris Hemsworth went full-frontal in 2015 comedy film Vacation – but not with his own asset. Co-director John Francis Daley admitted to Entertainment Tonight of the scene: “We had a choice between an eight-inch and a 10-inch prosthetic, and we tried them both on him in a room above the bedroom we were shooting.</p><p>“Just the three of us alone in a room sampling penises was a very strange experience for us.” It was for a good reason, however, as his own huge member would have been too distracting for audiences.</p><p>Daley added to Vulture: “There was a hapless stand-in who first came in when we were looking at the possibilities, and he’d put it on and have to show all the different options to us. It was the opposite of funny because you felt so bad for this poor stand-in.”</p><p>The eight-inch penis was eventually chosen, but it “did not look that big” on the star. Jonathan Goldstein admitted: “He makes the normal-sized penis look small.”</p><h3>Daniel Radcliffe</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i2-prod.dailystar.co.uk/incoming/article32292491.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_02442eb4f09021efa3e859b2f3af07b7.jpg><p>Though he’s best known for his role as a youngster in the Harry Potter franchise, Daniel Radcliffe is always up to star in a bizarre flick – and that’s just what he did in 2016 comedy Swiss Army Man, in which he played a corpse.</p><p>But part of that role had the corpse’s penis working as a real-life compass, and pointing to specific bearings as it was hauled around an island. Daniel told Metro: “The way the penis moves in the film, it was based on an animal called the tapir who have penises which are prehensile and can move around.</p><p>“Normally all of the animatronic stuff we had on Harry Potter, most were controlled by a guy with a little remote control. This, for some reason, was controlled by two gigantic levers that were on the side of the set that a guy was wrenching around to operate. Much hilarity was had with the animatronic penis."</p><h3>Charles Melton</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i2-prod.dailystar.co.uk/incoming/article32292487.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/1_Chris-Hemsworth-Chevy-Chase-Beverly-DAngelo-2-11-screenshot.jpg><p><b>For more of the latest showbiz news from Daily Star, make sure you sign up to one of our newsletters </b><a data-content-type=section data-link-tracking=InArticle|Link href=#><b>here.</b></a></p><p>In <a data-content-type=section-topic data-link-tracking=InArticle|Link href=#>Netflix</a> film May December, actor Charles Melton took one for the team as he chucked on a huge fake penis alongside Julianne Moore and Natalie Portman. The film follows a couple whose tabloid romance swept the nation decades ago, when Joe (Charles Melton) was 13 and Gracie (Julianne Moore) was in her 30s.</p><p>Charles bore the brunt of it when it came to wearing a heavy prosthetic for sex scenes, which took an epic “nine hours” to film. In one scene, the fake member is in full view of the camera, with Charles confessing it was rather “annoying”.</p><p>He explained: “There were a few conversations about the prosthetic, regarding what was realistic and what wasn't. And I had to wear that prosthetic for nine hours that day. I didn't have anything to drink that morning or the night before. That was an annoying process but still very respectful.”</p><p><b>Follow Daily Star on Threads </b><a href=# rel=nofollow><b>here.</b></a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pa3IpbCsrJGne6S7ja6iaKuYpMSjtdlorKxlo528uK7Is2acnZyar7R51qGmZqaVmrGmsIyfmKSdXaWyr7XSnqpma2JnhXmBlG4%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 DashJ - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
