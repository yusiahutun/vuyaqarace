Over the years, I’ve added a trench coat, cozy puffers, a leather bomber, and about four different teddy jackets. My penchant comes from the <strong>topper’s versatility</strong> — both my leggings and pantsuit look comfortable yet put-together when paired with a <strong>teddy coat</strong>. Stylist <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel=nocaes>Alison Bruhn</a> agrees that they’re “having a moment right now,” with more colors, lengths, and styles readily available at a <strong>variety of price points</strong>. Styles made from <strong>shearling</strong>, the traditional teddy coat material, tend to be expensive; however, those on a budget have <strong>alternative materials to consider</strong>.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-1 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Aside from being trendy, they’re also inter-seasonal with the <strong>ability to keep you cozy</strong> from fall until early spring, with layering options depending on the temperature. And when they look as cute as our favorite options do, you’ll want to get as much wear out of them as you can.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-overall-ugg-frankie-sherpa-trucker-jacket></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Overall</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Ugg Frankie Sherpa Trucker Jacket</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Frankie Sherpa Trucker Jacket" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/fQOfWVJxWDXBKJlIveNTK36_Gvs=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/ugg-frankie-sherpa-trucker-jacket-87e91888ba0f4d4e91b18c42b0a3d70b.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Ugg</p></span><p><strong>What We Love:</strong> The pockets are fleece-lined to keep your hands warm.</p><p><strong>What We Don't Love:</strong> Because of how deceivingly lightweight it is, it will require some layering to keep you warm.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-2 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Ugg is no stranger to creating soft and plush apparel, and this teddy jacket comes prepared to keep you cozy through the cold weather. Lined with fleece, the pockets will keep your hands toasty (in case you ever forget your gloves), and the two chest pockets offer a bit more storage opportunities for a folded mask or apartment key when you're running out for a quick errand — the side pockets don't appear to have any closure to them, so things might slip out, making the chest pockets significantly more useful.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-3 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">It might not be as warm as your typical cold-weather coat, though; Ugg confirmed that the jacket actually feels lightweight because it's intended for chilly spring or fall days. Thankfully, the oversized cut lets you <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>layer sweaters</a> underneath, so you can easily get away with wearing it in the winter without feeling too cold.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-4 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Material: </strong>Polyester, elastane<strong> | Size: </strong>XXS-3XL<strong> | Colors: </strong>5<strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-budget-merokeety-winter-long-sleeve-button-sherpa-jacket></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Budget</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Merokeety Winter Long Sleeve Button Sherpa Jacket</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="MEROKEETY Womens Winter Long Sleeve Button Sherpa Jacket" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/sIovoCIT5lSy5fs-aq__8zJ_VAA=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/merokeety-winter-button-sherpa-jacket-1ed4dd14dc174aa5950b22412e584ef6.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Amazon</p></span><p><strong>What We Love:</strong> It comes in 15 colors, giving you more options outside of your standard neutrals.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love: </strong>The sewing could be sturdier.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-7 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Anyone sick of the typical neutrals with teddy coats will appreciate the whopping 15 different colors this jacket comes in. With everything from hot pink to rust red to icy blue, you're bound to find something that speaks to you. And while it might look a bit thin, reviewers actually say they stayed warm in it — the lightweight layer can be thrown on top of warmer sweaters, too, especially if you size up for ample layering. Just note that stitches came undone rather quickly, especially around the pockets, and some holes formed faster than expected.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-8 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Material: </strong>Polyester, spandex<strong>| Size: </strong>XS-XL<strong> | Colors: </strong>15</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-splurge-stand-studio-black--off-white-edith-faux-shearling-jacket></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Splurge</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Stand Studio Black & Off-White Edith Faux Shearling Jacket</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Stand Studio Black &amp;amp; Off-White Edith Faux Shearling Jacket" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/rgr5Y7h7wAsEmOnqNf7XjRxtQ44=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/stand-studio-black--off-white-edith-faux-shearling-jacket-98b3994a97f045448d08ffd5b35dc678.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Ssense</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>Wide sleeves make it possible to layer thick sweaters underneath.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love: </strong>The boxy cut invites a breeze to seep in from the wide-opened hem.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-11 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">You would never guess that this stunning jacket is made of faux leather and faux shearling. The jacket is the closest thing you can get to the real deal, which is why the price is more on the splurgy side of the spectrum. While the interior is fluffed with a soft teddy texture, the exterior is a mix of suede and smooth faux leather. The fit is relatively relaxed, with boxy sleeves that give enough space to layer thick sweaters underneath. It does allow some wind to creep in via the wide hem, however. But because it is slightly cropped, it’s easier to style it with high-waisted bottoms or even dresses without looking like you’re being swallowed by your outfit. And just because it would be a shame not to mention it, the jacket has a matching <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="nofollow nocaes">faux-fur boot</a>, conveniently named Bianca, like me.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-12 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Material: </strong>Polyester, elastane, polyurethane | <strong>Colors: </strong>1 | <strong>Size: </strong>XXS–XXL</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-plus-size-good-american-sherpa-trench></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Plus-Size</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Good American Sherpa Trench</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Good American Sherpa Trench" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/RH8l9L_Vcabpj2k7UqYthOKHM8A=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/good-american-sherpa-trench-e4483e52ec6041d4b3cbeb39d397e7b8.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Good American</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>It can be styled up for work or down with sweatpants.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love: </strong>It only comes in one color, and it’s the least forgiving to showing stains and dirt.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-15 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">We know that <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>trench coats</a> are back in full swing right now, and this sherpa version marries two of our favorite styles into one. And of course, Good American always ensures there’s a size for everyone, ranging from extra extra small to five extra large. The oversized jacket invites you to snuggle up in its embrace and look just as good with work pants and sweatpants. It doesn’t have a button closure, however. The adjustable waist tie is all there is to keep the coat closed and air from seeping in. We also want you to do a quick self-analysis before purchasing, as this bone color is all there is and it’s not going to be stain-friendly. Make sure you’re confident in your ability to keep it clean.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-16 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Material: </strong>Polyester | <strong>Colors: </strong>1<strong> </strong>| <strong>Size: </strong>XXS–5XL</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-fleece-fp-movement-courtside-fleece></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Fleece</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>FP Movement Courtside Fleece</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="FP Movement Courtside Fleece" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/INS-zQol1IVzBgKwsMHNDUcv_lI=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/fp-movement-courtside-fleece-d88c60633f844b91af93ce57af39a882.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Free People</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>The zipper opens both top-down and bottom-up.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love: </strong>The boxy fit makes it difficult to find the right size.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-19 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Fleece jackets</a> are ideal for transitional weather. You know, when you don’t know if you should get a jacket or just opt for a <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>sweater</a>. Fleece jackets are the balanced medium, allowing you to keep it lightweight but still protected from the wind. This sherpa option is a stylish number to opt for, with contrasting black detailing along the collar, zip, and hem. The unique zipper can be opened top-down or bottom-up, allowing you to get a little creative with your look. The boxy fit also makes it possible to layer some thick sweaters underneath, although some reviews have stated that it’s a bit difficult to find the right size. Expect it to be on the large side, so size down if you prefer it more body-hugging.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-20 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Material: </strong>Polyester, nylon | <strong>Colors: </strong>5<strong> </strong>| <strong>Size: </strong>XS–XL</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-teddy-lined-ugg-takara-fleece-coat></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Teddy-Lined</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Ugg Takara Fleece Coat</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Ugg Takara Fleece Coat" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/voFqaGdeQ17vdW-PfJJIbYDOrv8=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/ugg-takara-fleece-coat-775cde19ab11422c925f75c85cd45057.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Nordstrom</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>Large fur-lined pockets exist for you to keep your hands nice and warm.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love: </strong>It’s a little oversized, so size down for a more fitted look.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-23 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Since you already trust Ugg with keeping your feet warm, it only makes sense to trust it in the jackets department as well. This teddy-lined fleece coat simply begs to be worn. The plush fabric can be found in the entire interior, as well as accented around the collar, pockets, sleeves, and lining throughout the exterior. The jacket is made to look oversized, so if you wish for a more fitted appeal then we recommend sizing down. You’ll still have plenty of space to layer your <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>wool sweaters</a> without feeling completely stuffed.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-24 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Material: </strong>Polyester | <strong>Colors: </strong>2<strong> </strong>| <strong>Size: </strong>XS–XL</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-puffer-the-north-face-high-pile-fleece-nuptse-jacket></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Puffer</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>The North Face High Pile Fleece Nuptse Jacket</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="The North Face High Pile Fleece Nuptse Jacket" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/ZgrSjoiKUF_rXYWvUKnfb7mOVhw=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/north-face-fleece-nuptse-jacket-e6f493f6d3ff4052b6a0cc847cb5fb82.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Nordstrom</p></span><p><strong>What We Love:</strong> With a 600-fill-power down, it’s extremely warm.</p><p><strong>What We Love:</strong> It doesn’t come with a hood like the classic North Face puffer does.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-27 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">As one of North Face’s warmest offerings, the teddy version of their classic puffer comes with 600-fill-power down, extra soft fleece, and Heatseeker Eco insulation — a 100 percent recycled fiber that stays warm during both wet and dry conditions. Compared to <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Hailey Bieber’s go-to North Face jacket</a>, this one comes slightly cropped but has the same loose silhouette that makes it so easy to layer underneath. And while it doesn’t have the same removable hood, it does have quite a high collar to keep your neck nice and warm. The jacket also comes in two colors on Nordstrom but can be found in dark green and blue on <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">North Face’s</a> webpage as well.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-28 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Material: </strong>Recycled polyester, high-pile fleece<strong> | Size: </strong>XS-3XL<strong> | Colors: </strong>4</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-coat-pretty-little-thing-tall-black-longline-borg-coat></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Coat</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Pretty Little Thing Tall Black Longline Borg Coat</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Pretty Little Thing Tall Black Longline Borg Coat" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/mhtseqKnNK-C6c9YzNzfK-PyBDk=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/pretty-little-thing-tall-black-longline-borg-coat-7fecf792c4f8471eac0dca9598bd797a.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Pretty Little Thing</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>It can be styled up and down, working well with both slippers and heels.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love: </strong>It’s cut for taller women.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-31 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">There’s nothing like snuggling into a long teddy coat and feeling ultra cozy. It’s the kind of coat that works both with casual loungewear and a dressier, dinner-with-friends type of getup. The jacket is cut for taller ladies, as noted on the display image and title, but we think coats still look stylish when they’re even floor-length, so most heights can consider this option. But just to be safe, take note that the model is five-foot-ten and the 51-inch coat reaches just below her knees. It may be worth measuring where the hem would fall on you before clicking purchase.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-32 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Material: </strong>Polyester | <strong>Colors: </strong>2<strong> </strong>| <strong>Size: </strong>2–12</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-cropped-camila-coelho-cleobella-cropped-faux-fur-jacket></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Cropped</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Camila Coelho Cleobella Cropped Faux Fur Jacket</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Camila Coelho Cleobella Cropped Faux Fur Jacket" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/X17ZbawNLJC-LdeKY26tddFaR9E=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/cleobella-cropped-faux-fur-jacket-629fa69ded014d38817cd761a2b9b456.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Revolve</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>The midweight faux fur is decently thick to keep you feeling toasty.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love: </strong>You can’t completely close the front.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-35 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">For when the temperatures are a little more forgiving, a cropped option such as this Cleoball jacket might be more appropriate. They also give you the chance to show off your outfit as it’s not completely covering it. Made of midweight faux fur, it’s decently thick and warm — the large sleeves also leave room for layering underneath. That all being said, there’s only a single front hook that closes the jacket, so it’s certainly not the most snug option. You may notice a breeze in the front. But hey, at least you’ll win plenty of style points walking around in it.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-36 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Material: </strong>Polyester<strong> </strong>| <strong>Colors: </strong>2<strong> </strong>| <strong>Size: </strong>XXS–XL</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-midweight-lamarque-badu-oversized-shearling-jacket></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Midweight</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Lamarque Badu Jacket</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Lamarque Badu Jacket" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/XqSglt2gf_9mAhK58LLnokiJhV4=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/revolve-badu-jacket-c663bc6fd6334c8b87b078e79c91c7c8.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Revolve</p></span><p><strong>What We Love:</strong> The oversized fit will let you layer a bunch of clothes underneath.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love:</strong> It only comes in beige, which will be difficult to keep clean.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-39 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">This midweight teddy jacket has some eye catching design elements, like faux leather trimmings, dropped shoulders, and belted sides, that give this piece a unique look. It comes in an oversized fit — the model is wearing a size small for reference — and can easily be worn over <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>thicker sweatshirts</a> if needed, which makes it ideal for multiple seasons. That being said, I would probably be careful not to wear it too often or in questionable weather as the beige color will be difficult to keep clean. And considering you can only dry-clean this piece, it can become a hassle to do so every few weeks.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-40 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Material: </strong>Polyester, polyurethane<strong> | Size: </strong>XS-XL <strong>| Colors:&nbsp;</strong>1</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-moto-madewell-oversized-shearling-motorcycle-jacket></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Moto</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Madewell Oversized Shearling Motorcycle Jacket</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Oversized Shearling Motorcycle Jacket" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/siA1y6CAbtCCUO7sGEqr32reNyc=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/madewell-shearling-motorcycle-jacket-160f6b1d08b04f30bb798277681131f6.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Madewell</p></span><p><strong>What We Love:</strong> It’s made of genuine leather and real shearling.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love:</strong> The real fur might shed slightly.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-43 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">When you’re ready to invest in a forever piece, this moto jacket is made of genuine leather with a timeless cut to ensure you a lifetime of wear. Yes, it’s pricier than some of the other options here, but you’ll never have to buy another thick, warm, leather jacket again. With its motorcycle appeal (which has been and will remain relevant for years to come), real shearling, and an oversized cut, this jacket can be paired with nearly everything and will remain sturdy and warm for decades to come. Shearling in its nature tends to shed ever so slightly on your first few wears. Give it a few months and it should even itself out with time.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-44 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Material: </strong>Genuine leather, teddy <strong>| Size: </strong>XXS-XXL <strong>| Colors:&nbsp;</strong>1</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-denim-levi-original-sherpa-trucker-jacket></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Denim</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Levi Original Sherpa Trucker Jacket</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Levi ORIGINAL SHERPA TRUCKER JACKET" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/GXJ2C9sP31ioFwrfl2C3pjhyFVg=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/levi-sherpa-trucker-jacket-1f24b4ec1a8640bd8aaedc6dc9a0ab55.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Levi</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>The teddy works to keep you warm from the interior lining.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love: </strong>The sleeves are a little short.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-47 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">We were delighted to find that Levi's updated their classic denim jacket with a teddy lining, allowing you to wear the versatile jacket in colder weather, too. But for those only interested in the teddy accents for warmth, aside from around the collar, you can’t really see the soft texture from the outside, so it’s only a subtle design detail, rather than an overt statement. And for those with a monochromatic wardrobe, the black version features black fur, instead of white for the other colorways. Overall, the jacket has a slim cut, which left a lot of shoppers confused about what size to opt for — the sleeves and the hem are cut a bit short, which can be annoying if you’re working with long limbs, so we suggest sizing up.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-48 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Material: </strong>Cotton<strong> | Size: </strong>XS-XL<strong> | Colors:&nbsp;</strong>3</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-biker-zara-faux-fur-biker-jacket></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Biker</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Zara Faux Fur Biker Jacket</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Zara Faux Fur Biker Jacket" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/FLejbQAq8r4rGX4fhnMGnbizMu4=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/zara-faux-fur-biker-jacket-c30116228a6947578cf3ffa57441a971.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Zara</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>You can completely cover the neck with its belted lapel collar.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love: </strong>It only comes in a cream color, which is prone to showing dirt and stains.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-51 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Leave it to Zara to make stylish pieces at reasonable prices. We can’t help but admire this faux shearling biker jacket. The large metallic zip down the front and the buckled lapel collar give it that rider aesthetic, while the faux fur softens the look to make it more casual for daily wear. Did we mention it completely covers the neck and protects you from the elements? In other words, not only is it cute with its black contrast stitching and boxy fit, but it’s amply warm for the winter, as well. Unfortunately, it only comes in this one cream color, which may be difficult to keep clean. If you’re feeling confident in your ability to maintain its condition, go ahead and shop this look.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-52 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Material: </strong>Polyester, polyurethane | <strong>Colors: </strong>| <strong>Size: </strong>XS–XL</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-what-to-keep-in-mind></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-heading--instyle commerce-sc-block-heading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>What to Keep in Mind</span></h2><ul id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-1 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><li><strong>Shearling vs. Teddy: </strong>Shearling and teddy are not one and the same. To begin, <strong>one describes a material and another a texture</strong>. Shearling is made of real fur, typically from a lamb, that has only been shorn (removed of fur) once. Teddy refers to the fluffy texture and can be made of both real or faux fur. Therefore, while shearling can be considered teddy, a teddy coat is not always shearling.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Material: </strong>Teddy can be constructed using <strong>real fur, cotton, or synthetic fibers</strong>, like polyester and acrylic. Faux fur made of the latter three options mimics the sheep-like fluff and is intended to work as an alternative to animal products. Cotton has a natural softness and comfort to it, so jackets that have an interior lining of teddy typically opt for this fabric. However, polyester functions better as an outerwear for its strong, rip-resistant, and quick-drying properties. You’ll notice that most of the options listed here, therefore, are made of polyester.</li><li><strong>Cut: </strong>Once you’ve decided on what type of texture and material you want your teddy jacket to be in, next you’ll have to decide the cut of the jacket. Are you looking for a <strong>long coat</strong> or something <strong>cropped</strong>? If you’re unsure and simply want something you can wear every day, a hem stopping <strong>just below your hips</strong> is the way to go.</li><li><strong>Closure: </strong>Your safest bet is opting for a <strong>zip closure</strong> if warmth is what you’re after. That being said, there’s no denying that a <strong>single button closure</strong> looks more appropriate on a long coat. And while we love a <strong>belt closure</strong>, it can run the risk of looking like a bathrobe (although a very chic one). Still, this option allows you to fully wrap your body in the coat as snug as you want before closing it.<br></li></ul><span class=heading-toc id=toc-your-questions-answered></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-2 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-heading--instyle commerce-sc-block-heading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Your Questions, Answered</span></h2><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-3 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--instyle commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>How do you style teddy coats?<br></span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-4 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Each teddy jacket comes with its own cut and style, which will ultimately require a different styling guide. But overall, the fuzzy look can be dressed up and down—or worn like a <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>throw-and-go shacket</a>—making it a versatile piece in your wardrobe.

Teddy jackets with no internal lining don’t put up a great fight against the wind. That’s why the combination of teddy with something more airtight makes for the warmest of jackets. Think genuine leather plus teddy, where the leather works to block out any air and seal in your body warmth. Another great option is teddy with goose down, where the exterior fur covers a thick cushion filled with goose down.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-why-shop-with-us></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-7 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-heading--instyle commerce-sc-block-heading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Why Shop With Us</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-8 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Bianca Kratky </a>is a commerce writer for InStyle with two years of experience covering fashion and lifestyle products.
