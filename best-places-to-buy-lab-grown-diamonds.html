Whether you’re shopping for an engagement ring, anniversary gift, promotion present, or just because, choosing jewelry crafted with lab-grown diamonds means purchasing a piece that is—in many cases—40 to 50 percent less in price than natural diamonds. Not to mention: They are just as dazzling with an origin that is impossible to detect.&nbsp;</p><p>Up ahead, we break down the details on lab-grown diamonds and share the best places to buy excellent lab-grown diamonds, according to jewelers and gemologists.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>The Best Places to Buy Excellent Lab-Grown Diamonds at a Glance&nbsp;</strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=the-difference-between-lab-grown-and-natural-diamonds>The Difference Between Lab-Grown and Natural Diamonds&nbsp;</h2><p>“There is no way to truly distinguish a <a href=# data-type=link data-id=https://stylecaster.com/fashion/shopping-guides/1645252/lab-grown-vs-natural-diamonds/>lab-grown diamond from a natural diamond</a>, even under a microscope,” says Sacha Jarmon, gemologist and co-founder of <a href=# rel=nofollow>Love Saro</a>. The main (and only) difference between lab-grown and natural diamonds is how they are created and sourced—either naturally in the earth and mined or in a lab. The end result is the same, and unless you have specialized equipment, you can’t tell which diamonds are naturally grown and which ones are lab-grown.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=why-choose-lab-grown-diamonds>Why Choose Lab-Grown Diamonds&nbsp;</h2><p>Lab-grown diamonds and natural diamonds are virtually the same, but there are some distinct reasons why you might choose a lab-grown diamond over an earth-mined diamond. The main selling point—and the reason why many people choose lab-grown diamonds over natural diamonds—is that lab-grown diamonds are significantly more affordable. Since this process cuts out the mining process and is handled by fewer people throughout their creation, they are ultimately a lot more cost-effective.&nbsp;</p><p>Additionally, Jarmon notes that lab-grown diamonds are a more sustainable and ethical choice. Mining is a dangerous process that disrupts the environment and comes with a larger ecological footprint. Growing diamonds in a lab cuts out the dangerous mining process and is a smaller-scale operation that is more eco-friendly.</p><p>Despite being cheaper and having a different origin story, lab-grown diamonds are comparable to natural diamonds in terms of quality. “These days, most [lab-grown diamonds] from reputable jewelers or companies should come with a GIA certification when they reach 0.15 carat or larger,” Jarmon notes.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=what-is-the-highest-grade-of-lab-grown-diamonds>What is the Highest Grade of Lab-Grown Diamonds?</h2><p>Since there isn’t a difference between lab-grown diamonds and natural diamonds, lab-grown stones are graded using the same criteria as earth-mined diamonds, says <a href=# rel=nofollow>Larry “Flowers” Yadan</a>, a celebrity jeweler and the official jeweler for the Los Angeles Kings. This includes the 4 Cs, aka cut, color, clarity, and carat weight. “The highest grade for lab-grown diamonds would typically involve diamonds that exhibit exceptional qualities in each of these categories,” he explains.</p><p>Although the highest grade can vary depending on individual preferences, Kristy Cullinane, the co-founder of <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Plum Diamonds</a>, says the highest grade of lab-grown diamonds is D color, FL clarity, and excellent or ideal cut. “This would be a colorless, flawless diamond,” she remarks.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=what-is-the-best-type-of-lab-grown-diamond>What Is the Best Type of Lab-Grown Diamond?</h2><p>Yadan says the best type of lab-grown diamond will depend on personal preference and priorities. “In general, high-quality lab-grown diamonds are those that exhibit excellent clarity, color, and cut,” he explains. “Diamonds with minimal inclusions and blemishes, a color grade of D to H (colorless to near-colorless), and a well-proportioned cut that maximizes brilliance and sparkle are typically considered desirable.”&nbsp;</p><p>It’s also worth considering diamonds certified by reputable gemology laboratories, such as the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Gemological Institute of America</a> (GIA) or the <a href=# data-type=link data-id=https://www.igi.org/ rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">International Gemological Institute</a> (IGI). Yadan says these labs provide assurance of quality and authenticity.&nbsp;</p><p>In addition to ensuring diamonds are grown and cut properly, Cullinane says to ensure the sources are vetted for ethics and sustainability. “This will be the most stunning visually and the best option for the planet.”&nbsp;</p><p>If you’re shopping for lab-grown diamonds and not sure where to start, consider these top picks for the best places to buy excellent lab-cut diamonds, according to jewelry and gemstone experts.&nbsp;</p><ul class="pmc-fallback-list-items lrv-a-unstyle-list lrv-u-margin-t-2"><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=2.6041666666667><h2>Best Place to Buy Engagement Rings: Brilliant Earth</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/brillant-earth_7f8d00.jpg><p>Brilliant Earth is one of the best places to buy lab-grown diamond engagement rings, thanks to its user-friendly shopping experience.
