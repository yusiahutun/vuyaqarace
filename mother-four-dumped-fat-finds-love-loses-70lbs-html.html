Despite this, Miriam struggled to feel good enough and she would often tell him she'd understand if he left her for someone else.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>She spent a lot of time wishing that she was thinner, but never found the motivation to do anything about it - until September 2015 when Miriam was involved in a car accident that left her suffering from back pain for months on end.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Despite visiting a chiropractor for six months, Miriam's condition failed to improve, and she was eventually diagnosed with a herniated disc.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>She was offered a surgery that had a 50/50 chance of relieving the pain she was in.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Not wanting to risk the procedure or rely on pain relief medication, Jordan, who is a navy veteran, suggested that Miriam do some strength exercises to strengthen her back to see if she noticed any relief.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Miriam soon fell in love with working out and healthy eating and, to her surprise, she found that the weight melted away. Now, Miriam is a super svelte 150lbs and a size 4 to 6, and she has no back pain.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>The busy mom is in the best shape of her life and says there are no excuses to achieving weight loss goals. She still works out everyday despite sometimes working 12 hour shifts as well as looking after the home â€“ but people are surprised to learn that she still enjoys burgers, chips and pizza as a treat.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'I remember years ago always covering myself up. I know I've said it before but I felt like everyone could see my saggy skin and stretch marks. I felt ugly on the inside and out,' said Miriam.&nbsp;</p><h2>RELATED ARTICLES</h2><ul class="rotator-pages link-xocc"><li class=rotator-prev><a href=# data-page=prev>Previous</a></li><li><a href=# data-page=1>1</a></li><li class=rotator-next><a href=# data-page=next>Next</a></li></ul><ul class="rotator-panels link-bogr1 linkro-ccox"><li><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2020/09/01/10/32636538-0-image-a-6_1598952514342.jpg width=62 height=60 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto> <span>The toddler who's better dressed than you!

I was driving down the street from my house when out of nowhere I got t-boned. A truck hit me on my side of my truck. The truck wasn't too bad, but the next couple of days I noticed I was a bit stiff.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'The pain in my back got worse and worse as days went by. Finally, I went to see a specialist for surgery and he told me that I was too young for this. He said that if I was his sister, he wouldn't want the surgery to be done.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'At the time my girls were young. My two youngest were about two and four. Relying on pain meds was not an option. My husband always worked out, he always loved working out and knew about eating healthy and bodybuilding. He told me let's try and strengthen my back.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'We signed me up to a gym. I was a bit self-conscious because everyone at the gym was beautiful to me. My husband said everyone is here for the same reason as you are.
