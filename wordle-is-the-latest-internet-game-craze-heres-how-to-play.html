Killing productivity everywhere, <a href=#>Wordle</a> gives players a new word to guess every day, but you only have six tries to get it right. So here's what you need to know and how to play Wordle.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The game was created by&nbsp;<a href=# rel=noopener data-url=https://twitter.com/powerlanguish data-component-tracked=1>Josh Wardle</a>&nbsp;back in 2013 as a fun little side project that he brought back to life during the pandemic to stay entertained. Now, we're seeing posts all over social media <a href=#>talking about it</a> and <a href=#>waiting for the next Wordle</a>. If you're seeing friends and family post images of green, yellow, black, or gray squares, it's because they're playing Wordle.</p><h2 id=where-to-play-wordle>Where to Play Wordle?</h2><p>If you want to partake in the shenanigans,&nbsp;<a href=#>here's where you can play Wordle</a>. Once you click, learn how to play, and <a href=#>guess today's word</a>, you're all done. Then, your web browser will remember the spot and serve up a new wordle to guess tomorrow.</p><p>It's that easy to get started as there's no&nbsp;mobile app to download or anything. Instead, visit the website, guess the five-letter word, and share your results on social media. Careful, though, you don't want to give away the answer---only share how many tries it took for you to guess correctly.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=how-to-play-wordle>How to Play Wordle?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/42aeaba5.png> Wordle<p>Guess the word in six tries or less, and it's that simple. When you visit the <a href=#>Wordle website</a> for the first time, you'll get a set of instructions on how to play.</p><p>To start, guess the Wordle in six tries or less. After each guess, the color of the tiles on your screen will change to let you know if you're close or not. For example, yellow is warm, and green is hot.</p><ul><li><strong>Green</strong> tiles mean the letter you guessed is in the word and in the correct spot.</li><li><strong>Yellow</strong> tiles confirm the letter is in the word but in a different square.</li><li>And <strong>Gray</strong> tiles mean the letter doesn't belong anywhere in the word.</li></ul><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Take your time, think it through, and guess the word before you run out of guesses. The correctly guessed green letter will stay in its place, giving you a Jeopardy-like experience. It sounds easy, but don't get too confident just yet. And if you start playing and need a little help, here are the best <a href=#>Wordle starting words</a> for the best chance at success.</p><p>Every day there's a new five-letter word for you to guess, and it'll typically show up around midnight. Good luck!</p><h2 id=how-long-will-wordle-last>How Long Will Wordle Last?</h2><p>If you start to get addicted to Wordle, as we are, don't worry about the game running out of words anytime soon. According to the <a href=#>New York Times</a>, the game's creator says roughly 2,500 words in the queue, meaning we have a few years to play.</p><p>Everything is random, too, so even Wardle doesn't know which word will come up tomorrow or the day after that. It looks like the creator doesn't have any plans to make a mobile app version, nor will he charge money for the game. Instead, it's just a fun thing for everyone to enjoy, and we all could use a little of that these days.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>It's worth noting that all of the hype around this game is bringing out both the best and the worst when it comes to social media. There's even a new Twitter bot that will spoil tomorrow's word when people share results on Twitter.
