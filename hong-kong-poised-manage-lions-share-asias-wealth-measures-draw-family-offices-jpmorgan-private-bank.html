The government has set a ­target of attracting 200 new family offices to the city by 2025.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Hong Kong has “always been a thriving international financial centre”, but like other parts of the world, it has had to navigate several macroeconomic challenges like geopolitics, inflation and supply chain constraints, Patel said.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-TitleText class="css-66qo9a eeeqn932">Wealth Management Connect scheme to increase eligibility, product range, limits</span></p></a></h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">This has affected the private wealth management sector in Hong Kong, which experienced a decline in assets under management and a drop in inflows last year as investment returns suffered, according to the KPMG 2023 wealth management report.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Even so, Patel said she is “confident that Hong Kong is going to go from strength to strength”.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“There’s lots of macro and geopolitical considerations that are playing through clients’ minds, but they’ve all got global ambitions,” said Patel. “All our clients are ambitious for their companies and for their personal fortunes.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The bank will be celebrating its 100th anniversary in Hong Kong next year.
