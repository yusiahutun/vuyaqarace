What he means is that he tries to behave slightly better, be nicer, and have empathy for what others are going through.</p><h2 class=content-title id=title-5>According to James McAvoy, acting came to him like an accident.</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/facts.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Anne-Marie_DuffJamesMcAvoyBAFTA07.jpg><p>Aside from priesthood, he also had other options for a choice of career. Acting did not even cross his mind. It was only until a director came to his school and talked about the entertainment business that McAvoy knew that he wanted to try it. After the talk, he approached David Hayman and asked for some work. It just so happens that Hayman was directing the Near Room which became McAvoy’s debut in the acting scene.</p><h2 class=content-title id=title-6>James McAvoy's movie "Atonement" got him a nomination in the Golden Globe.</h2><p>Atonement was a 2007 film based on Ian McEwan’s novel. James McAvoy was the love interest of Keira Knightley in that film. Critics and movie enthusiasts say that it was one of his most moving performances. With that, he got a spot as a nominee in the Golden Globe.</p><h2 class=content-title id=title-7>A 2001 miniseries was James McAvoy's biggest break.</h2><p>In 2001, Tom Hanks and Steven Spielberg produced an HBO miniseries—Band of Brothers. McAvoy only appeared in one episode as James W. Miller but it was all that he needed to make a career boom. From there, he landed notable roles in movies like Shameless, The Last King of Scotland, and Chronicles of Narnia. He also wowed film enthusiasts and the audience with his roles in X-Men, Split, Glass, and many more.</p><h2 class=content-title id=title-8>James McAvoy was drunk when he first met the director of Split.</h2><p>Remember when McAvoy said that he was owing most of his success from luck? This is proof of one of those. In one of his interviews, James McAvoy said that he first met Split’s director, M. Night Shyamalan, when he was very drunk. It was during the 2015 San Diego Comic-Con and there was a big party with a lot of famous people. They bumped into each other, exchanged a few words (which McAvoy said he could barely remember). But a month later, he was already playing the lead role of Shyamalan’s movie, Split. Whether he was drunk or not, there must be something that Shyamalan saw in him that made him pick him for the role.</p><h2 class=content-title id=title-9>Hedwig was James McAvoy's favorite character to play in the film Split.</h2><p>We already know that McAvoy played the main role of Kevin, a man with 24 alter egos, in the movie Split. When asked which character he liked most, he said that it was Hedwig, a personality of a 9-year-old boy. McAvoy said that the role was goofy and innocent, at the same time nasty and vindictive. He had a lot of fun while playing the role as it allowed him to make the audience laugh and feel at ease. And then while they’re feeling all too safe with what Hedwig was showing, they feel the <a href=# data-wpel-link=internal>fear</a> again.</p><p>Read also: <a href=# data-wpel-link=internal><span>10 Morgan Wallen Facts Life Music and Impact of the Country Music Star</span></a></p><h2 class=content-title id=title-10>James McAvoy is a big softie.</h2><p>In a sit-down interview, James McAvoy revealed that he cries so easily. It may not be that surprising as he’s in the acting industry but he says that without all the lights, he’s a big softie. What’s even more surprising is that he’s not afraid to reveal that he’s been watching ‘Mean Girls’.</p><p>This article belongs to <a href=# data-wpel-link=internal>Facts.net</a> and may not be reproduced, copied, edited, published, transmitted, or uploaded in any way without the permission of Facts.net.</p><h2 class=content-title id=title-11>Marrying Duff made the world less scary for James McAvoy.</h2><p>In a radio show hosted by Ryan Seacrest, McAvoy was asked why he did not wait to marry longer. Delaying his marriage could mean that he could earn more and exploit all that’s in store for him because he’s already famous. But McAvoy said that marrying Duff was a dream come true. She was the woman of her <a href=# data-wpel-link=internal>dreams</a> and when they are together, he likes himself a little more.</p><h2 class=content-title id=title-12>James McAvoy admires Samuel L. Jackson.</h2><p>While the actor was promoting the post-production of ‘Split’, he said that he admires the no-nonsense personality of Samuel Jackson. He said that the man is not afraid to tell what he thinks and drops the F-bomb without a care in the world. McAvoy found it funny and said that he might just follow Jackson’s example when he already has the balls to do it.</p><h2 class=content-title id=title-13>The flat in North London is where James McAvoy and Duff spend most of their time.</h2><p>Before marrying, McAvoy purchased a two-story flat for 178,000 pounds. They enjoyed their new home and chose to mostly stay inside to play sudoku puzzles. Some might say that James McAvoy’s lifestyle is mundane. But according to the actor, he just loves it that way.</p><h2 class=content-title id=title-14>James McAvoy is a big fan of the Celtic Football Club.</h2><p>Aside from science fiction and acting, one of his biggest interests is <a href=# data-wpel-link=internal>football</a>. He’s a big fan of the Football Club. If given the chance, the actor said it would be a dream if he will be able to play the role of Jimmy Johnston, a Celtic legend.</p><h2 class=content-title id=title-15>A 1985 film is James McAvoy's favorite film.</h2><p>One might think that it would be hard for actors to have film favorites other than the ones that they starred on. But McAvoy was able to answer it straightforwardly when asked. He said that it’s an adventure-comedy film in 1985, “The Goonies”. The storyline was by Steven Spielberg and was directed by Richard Donner.</p><h2 class=content-title id=title-16>James McAvoy did a base jump from the world's tallest hospital.</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/facts.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/jakob-owens-CiUR8zISX60-unsplash.jpg><p>In a bid to raise awareness and money for the charity Retrak, McAvoy did a terrifying jump from the tallest hospital building in the world. The charity assists homeless children in Uganda.</p><h2 class=content-title id=title-17>The movie 'The Last King of Scotland' made James McAvoy a charity advocate.</h2><p>While he was in Uganda shooting the movie, he could not believe what he’s seeing. He was there for a few months for the film and after finishing, he decided to be involved with charity causes and raising awareness. In 2007, he even went back to Uganda with the British Red Cross to support the projects of the group.</p><h2 class=content-title id=title-18>James McAvoy has a straightforward opinion about how films are made.</h2><p>According to the actor, 3D films are, in a sense, a total waste of money. James McAvoy thinks that film studios just use the effect to get more money from their audiences. Also, he thinks that British filmmakers could be so much more. McAvoy believes that British filmmakers dumb down productions and storylines to please the audiences in the <a href=# data-wpel-link=internal>US</a>. What a way to convey one’s thoughts.</p><h2 class=content-title id=title-19>A Waltham watch is one of James McAvoy's most prized possessions.</h2><p>According to critics, McAvoy is not someone who flaunts much of his wealth. But he does indulge himself when it’s all about adventure gears. In fact, one of his most favorite things is the 1950’s Waltham watch. It’s from an American company that manufactures instruments for wartime aircraft and expeditions in the South Pole.</p><h2 class=content-title id=title-20>James McAvoy has over 30 films.</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/facts.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/laurynas-mereckas-Z2h10lcXXfU-unsplash.jpg><p>Throughout his career, James McAvoy has had over 30 films to date.
