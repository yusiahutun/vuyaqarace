That said, we’ll cut Craig Thomas and Carter Bays some slack, mainly because they had to figure out a way to keep the show moving forward in the face of the unexpected dual pregnancies of series stars Alyson Hannigan and Cobie Smulders. And while the series finale didn’t give us any specific indication of who the titular (heh) mother of the show will be, there is one little matter about the show’s finale that we’d like to discuss. As you might expect, spoilers follow.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-9849af90ba34ad767eaa1b83b95d26af-3-0-0@published data-word-count=166>So, you guys, what was up with that ending? We applaud the now-31-year-old Ted Mosby for finally realizing that he’d rather spend his time educating the youth of America as a college professor than toiling away as a professional architect, but was anyone else a little bit creeped out to learn that Ted will soon be dipping his pen in the company ink (so to speak)? We’re all for consensual dalliances between students and professors, we suppose, but we never figured Ted shared <a href=#>Wooderson’s proclivities</a> (only swap in “college” for “high school”). Now, we have no idea if Ted ends up teaching undergrads or graduate students, or that the titular mother that he meets will even be a student — we suppose there’s an outside chance she was lurking in the back of that classroom as a janitor, Good Will Hunting style — but we’ll come right out and say it: The <a href=#>first person we thought of when last night’s episode concluded</a> was Mary Kay Letourneau.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-9849af90ba34ad767eaa1b83b95d26af-4-0-0@published data-word-count=2>Just us?</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-9849af90ba34ad767eaa1b83b95d26af-5-0-0@published data-word-count=8><a href=#>How I Met Your Mother: The Leap</a> [CBS.com]</p><span class=ambrose-short-hed>How I Met Your Significantly Younger Mother</span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7t8HLrayrnV6YvK57kWlncmdganypu9aYoJillamsurvUq5asoZejtqe1wpqlraSplMZvtNOmow%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 DashJ - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
