These sweet flower-shaped earrings from Lonna & Lilly feature petals made from imitation pearls and centers made from silver crystals and gold metal. They’re a lovely way to add a little glitz to an everyday ensemble without being too loud. As such, they’ll take your giftee from work to happy hour and even to the gym seamlessly.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-ted-baker-london-harly-heart-stud-earrings></span><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Ted Baker Heart Stud Earrings</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Nordstrom Ted Baker London Harly Heart Stud Earrings" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/cNJ-uc6TLmGmV6ZckWhtc7hqCwQ=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/ted-baker-london-harly-heart-stud-earrings-3a54f10a9aab40d98a42991a64ec8f6d.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Nordstrom</p></span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-4 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Make sure you know your giftee is into heart-shaped jewelry (and, well, has their ears pierced) before you buy them these earrings, but other than that, these are a true crowd pleaser. Since these are tiny studs and come in a selection of rose gold, gold, or silver-toned metals, they’ll fit nicely with any outfit under the sun and for any occasion too. They’re also engraved with the brand name and come in a lovely pastel jewelry box for a little taste of something designer but at a fraction of the price.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-eliot-danori-gold-tone-pav-drop-earrings></span><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Eliot Danori Pavé Drop Earrings</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Macy's Eliot Danori Gold-Tone Pav&amp;Atilde;&amp;copy; Drop Earrings" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/tDhW9MGPYwfpe42oevtfJdy3x-c=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/eliot-danori-gold-tone-pav-drop-earrings-ec9e68d8a39c4d28b0f55ed45d2597a3.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Macy's</p></span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-6 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">For your more glamorous friend who always seems to get invited to galas, premieres, and private social clubs, nothing less than this pair of glitzy drop earrings will do. Despite being very shiny, thanks to their selection of pavé crystals set in gold or silver metal, these teardrop jewels aren’t actually over the top at all. They simply say “sophisticated party.” Plus, you get that high-end effect for a really reasonable price, so we’d call that an all-around win.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-swanky-designs-womens-leaia-arch-stud-earrings></span><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Swanky Designs Arch Stud Earrings</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Macy's Swanky Designs Women's Leaia Arch Stud Earrings" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/2nlvClZa3MW1_caSMQncnUieCLo=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/swanky-designs-womens-leaia-arch-stud-earrings-eaf3b8d38d804af8b118b6bdaa46985c.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Macy's</p></span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-8 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">While you have to know your recipient quite well to decide whether they would like these funky earrings, what’s for sure is that we really do. Made from polymer clay, they consist of a circle on the lobe, then drop down into an upside down U shape, in bright, contrasting, swirly colors that are ready to party. Also, Swanky Designs is Black- and woman-owned, and each piece is handmade in the USA, which is just really cool and always a selling point in our book.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-baublebar-sip-sip-hooray-champagne-drop-earrings></span><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>BaubleBar Champagne Drop Earrings</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Nordstrom BaubleBar Sip Sip Hooray Champagne Drop Earrings" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/x5GX-fyHFj4Zpxok_aDY8zyFaso=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/baublebar-sip-sip-hooray-champagne-drop-earrings-2d5c92348e00485284ee97704e1bb280.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Nordstrom</p></span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-10 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">If your giftee is graduating from an academic program, has just gotten engaged, or has just received a promotion, chances are they’ll already be getting given more bubbly than they can handle — but that doesn’t mean you can’t get in on the fun. These drop earrings from BaubleBar are shaped like full champagne flutes, and are embellished with the panoply of crystals and imitation pearls to match their whole aesthetic. They also come ready to present to your loved one in a fun gift box with a cute celebratory message inside.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-ben-oni-pave-and-baguette-cubic-zirconia-huggie-hoop-earrings></span><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Ben Oni Huggie Hoop Earrings</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Macy's Ben Oni Pave and Baguette Cubic Zirconia Huggie Hoop Earrings" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/gnx1RlGyvlaLrqzQY_BcZnIjtDI=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/ben-oni-pave-and-baguette-cubic-zirconia-huggie-hoop-earrings-7ed770a463564f6b88d9d36e9f9d2658.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Macy's</p></span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-12 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Hoop earrings</a> are a great option for the more classic of your friends and some huggie earrings might very well be the way to go. Made from silver-plated brass and embellished with pavé and baguette-shaped cubic zirconia crystals, these ones from Ben Oni are both easy to pull off for just about anyone and still a lot of fun —&nbsp;the best of both worlds, basically. Also, these look luxe as heck, but keep the price tag down by not using actual gemstones. Last but not least, we appreciate that the brand is Black- and woman-owned.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-duruyeh-the-foldover></span><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Duruyeh The Foldover</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Duruyeh The Foldover" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/7HOlBWNdL6hGZKrMt6tomxO6hmI=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/duruyeh-the-foldover-c5c520e1210a43fcaaebcb3b9ed96775.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Duruyeh</p></span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-14 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">There’s nothing quite like the rush of discovering an indie brand with a beautiful concept and even more beautiful products. That’s how we felt when we first heard about Duruyeh, a Ghana-based brand whose guiding principle is “art for your ears,” creating small collections of luxurious earrings, all coming in at under $100. As well as being a gorgeous earring made from 18K gold-plated sterling silver, the Foldover also has a gorgeous significance, symbolizing “bending but not breaking” in the face of life changes. Ideal for your friend who’s just entered a big new chapter.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-danielle-jonas-co-the-daisy-pearl-earrings></span><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Danielle Jonas Co.

The Daisy is a pair of earrings with an irregular O shape on the lobe, embellished with a faux freshwater pearl, and falling down into an upside down U below. They’re available in just solid sterling silver or in gold-plated sterling silver, to suit your giftee’s tastes in jewelry.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-amer-new-york-the-wren-studs></span><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Amer New York The Wren Studs</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Amer New York The Wren Studs" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/DNtnnBNynEvwff9ZpZXxGDmRqPE=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/amer-new-york-the-wren-studs-42dbd2b12ee44ac7b186541d70183ce2.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Amer New York</p></span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-18 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">A single stud can make an especially thoughtful present for a friend who’s just gotten a new <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>ear piercing</a> — especially when it’s as lovely and special as this one, made from solid 14K yellow or white gold and adorned with three little diamonds. Amer New York is a wonderful brand to have on your radar as well: The&nbsp;label was founded by two sisters, who use only ethically sourced gemstones and handcraft each piece in New York City. All of Amer’s jewelry is designed to become future heirlooms, meaning your giftee can wear these studs for years and think of you every time.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-lele-sadoughi-acetate-small-lily-drop-earrings></span><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Lele Sadoughi Lily Drop Earrings</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Saks Fifth Avenue Lele Sadoughi Acetate Small Lily Drop Earrings" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/_Gws13xvllNWUwKebEnrSr0V1-U=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/lele-sadoughi-acetate-small-lily-drop-earrings-3a7e1535718d45d184378ce1122e16d0.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Saks Fifth Avenue</p></span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-20 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Some earrings have the power to make an entire outfit, and these by Lele Sadoughi are one such pair. Made out of acetate and 14k gold-plated brass, they are shaped like lilies in a swirly shade of turquoise that looks like someone’s pool in the Hollywood Hills. Paired with a natural linen dress or white palazzo pants, they scream summer vacation, but they can also complement a darker fall look beautifully.

Available in more affordable vermeil, or luxe 14K or 18K gold, you also get to choose between gold, silver, and rose gold colors according to what your giftee likes best. These earrings consist of three metal bars of different lengths, with one resting in front of the lobe and two in the back. They’re also super versatile, since the middle bar can be worn by itself, sans the other two.

But what if we told you there’s such a thing as heart-shaped jewelry that’s not overly sentimental or on the nose? That’s what designer label Oscar de la Renta has achieved here, with a row of gold-tone brass hearts made to look like they were “crushed,” which also allows them to reflect the light better since there are more angles to play with.

The stone is cut in a fun and unexpected shape, though overall this is quite a classic necklace, so any recipient will love it.

This locket necklace comes in three declinations, with a book cover on the front, and that book’s most memorable quote written inside. The Jane Eyre option comes with the words, “I would rather be happy than dignified;” the Pride and Prejudice version says, "To be fond of dancing was a certain step towards falling in love;” and the Little Women one reads, "Don't try and make me grow up before my time."

It’s sold as a single earring, designed for your recipient to wear on their right ear so the longer chain sits towards their neck, but you can contact the seller if you prefer to purchase it as a pair.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-jennifer-meyer-extra-small-heart-18-karat-gold-turquoise-earrings></span><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Jennifer Meyer Heart Gold Turquoise Earrings</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Net-A-Porter Jennifer Meyer Extra Small Heart 18-Karat Gold Turquoise Earrings" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/XAFKX7a9KKjowmoM9-f31gotJvY=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/jennifer-meyer-extra-small-heart-18-karat-gold-turquoise-earrings-316dba0cf7ec46af82f951c984dcf9bf.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Net-A-Porter</p></span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-101 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">We’re high-key obsessed with everything <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Jennifer Meyer</a> puts out into the world.
