They just kinda vaguely wanted it to be good (like a nice dashboard, at least), and not break the bank.</p><p>The answer is‚Ä¶ c‚Äômon I‚Äôm just one dude! üòµ‚Äçüí´</p><p>I‚Äôve never done an in-depth competitive analysis of the whole market. In a way, it‚Äôs <a href=#>too big to review</a>, and honestly you probably just have to look around and make a choice and hopefully, it‚Äôs fine.</p><p>And now, I shall spit out some more words about my own experiences and poking around.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i0.wp.com/chriscoyier.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/flywheel-brand-refresh-primary-logo.png><p>All my WordPress sites, including this one, are hosted by <a href=#>Flywheel</a>. They have plans as little as $13/month ($150/year), and it scales up with what seems to me fair pricing from there. I do find their monthly visits caps a little low. The admin area for managing your sites is nicely designed and has all the things you‚Äôd expect. I‚Äôve found the support good. I especially like that they are who created <a href=#>Local</a>, although I rarely use any of the features that directly connect the hosting to it, so it would still be useful on any other host. Disclosure: Flywheel used to sponsor CSS-Tricks when I ran that. But I honestly do like the hosting and don‚Äôt have any experience with anything I like better.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i0.wp.com/chriscoyier.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/WPE-LOGO-H-Default-OpenGraph-1200x628-1.png><p>Flywheel is actually now owned by <a href=#>WP Engine</a>, so it‚Äôs possible someday WP Engine eat it up. It took about <a href=#>a decade for that to happen to Media Temple</a>.</p><p>WP Engine itself is a very legit choice, too. Their lowest option starts a bit higher at $20/month, but theirs options for plans with multiple sites are actually lower. WP Engine also owns some of the biggest and most important plugins and themes in the industry, so they are a major player that likely ain‚Äôt going anywhere. I‚Äôve never tried it, but I have heard good things.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i0.wp.com/chriscoyier.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/download.png><p>It should be known that WordPress.com is an actual option now. It used to be just the place for do-it-all-for-me mode where you mostly just pick a theme but otherwise not have much control. That‚Äôs changed, and now on the $25/month plan an higher you get SFTP/SSH access, MySQL access, the ability to install plugins, and whatever else you want. So just like any other WordPress hosting really, except you can‚Äôt touch the WordPress installation itself, which is updated for you. Theoretically, about as secure as it gets.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i0.wp.com/chriscoyier.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Screenshot-2023-09-20-at-12.15.46-PM.png><p>If you like the idea of trusting Automattic to get WordPress hosting right, they also have <a href=#>Pressable</a>. Their personal plan is the same price as the Business plan on WordPress.com, so it‚Äôs very unclear to me when you‚Äôd pick one over the other. Also with both: you get Jetpack which has stuff like realtime backups which is pretty cool. It‚Äôs unclear if you get stuff like Jetpack Search, which I find very good and would be nice if you did. I see Pressable does support over Slack which seems kinda cool.</p><p>There are also the ones that, inexplicably to me, <a href=#>WordPress.org recommends</a>: Bluehost and DreamHost. Bluehost has a plan that starts at a rock-bottom $2.95/month, which ‚Äúrebills‚Äù at $11.99 and I can‚Äôt find how long the less expensive price goes for, so it‚Äôs probably just that first month. Still cheap. DreamHost is even cheaper at $2.59 for the first month and $5.99 after. That‚Äôs so low that I imagine they need to cut corners somewhere and how can it possibly be any good? Just a feeling! Never tried either, and it‚Äôs worth something that those are the only other two recommends from the whole WordPress open source project, but they both seem awfully suspicious.</p><p>There‚Äôs also GoDaddy too with <a href=#>WordPress-specific plans</a> starting at $8.99. I actually don‚Äôt mind GoDaddy for domains but I‚Äôm afraid I‚Äôve never heard anyone ever say anything good about the hosting so I‚Äôm personally wary there.</p><p>Are there more choices than this?</p><p>YES.</p><p><a href=#>Kinsta!</a> (never tried it, looks fancy)</p><p>Surely there are dozens if not hundreds of more web hosts that can and do host WordPress websites. All you need is the ol‚Äô <a href=#>LAMP</a> stack to get it done. Plus there is niche stuff like <a href=#>Strattic</a> that does it static or headless style, and <a href=#>SpinupWP</a> that helps you run WordPress on cloud providers.</p><p>Me, I‚Äôd lean toward a host that specializes in it.</p><p>OK one more thing.</p><p><strong>ISN‚ÄôT IT FRIGGIN CRAZY THAT NONE OF THEM WANT TO HELP YOU WITH DEPLOYMENT?</strong></p><p>My god. Give me a Git repo where the <code>main</code> branch deploys. Maybe even do build previews for me on the other branches if you really wanna do something premium for me.</p><p><h3 class=jp-relatedposts-headline>Related</h3></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmibmKe2tK%2FOsqCeql6jsrV7kWlpbGdgbnxzfI6wpqucoKeytL%2BMoaasrJmjtG6tw6%2BgnJ1f</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 DashJ - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
