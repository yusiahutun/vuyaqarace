Although she unfortunately didn’t get the part she auditioned for, it seems she won in other ways. The <a href=#>celebrity</a> couple has been married for 26 years, and although they’ve been through issues publically, from Jada’s latest post, it looks like the love is still as strong as ever.</p><figure class="wp-block-grvmedia-grv-video GRVMultiVideo"></figure><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.celebritytidbit.com/uploads/39/2023/09/GettyImages-1388124310-792x1024.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-jada-shares-will-smith-s-full-name-in-adorable-birthday-post>Jada shares Will Smith’s full name in adorable birthday post</h2><p>Taking to her 11.4 million <a href=#>Instagram</a> followers, the 52-year-old shared a throwback photo of herself and her husband, with their children, Jaden and Willow. The I Am Legend star’s eldest child, Trey, is also in the family snap, who he shares with his ex-wife&nbsp;Sheree Zampino.</p><p>In the lengthy adorable caption, Jada used her husband’s full name, Willard, and some fans were in shock at the revelation.</p><p>“Willard, I am so glad you were born on this day,” she wrote. Without you I would not have experienced the greatest joy of my life… the love of our family. On this Divine assignment we’ve chosen to walk together, I am grateful for the wells of laughter along the trails of tears we’ve shared.</p><p>“Thank you for helping me learn to embrace it all … with a smile. Here’s to 100+ more birthdays full of growth, acceptance, and joy,” the Red Table Talk host concluded.</p><p>Willard himself, celebrated his birthday on the ‘gram by posting a throwback video of himself on his 50th, bungee jumping out of a helicopter over the Grand Canyon.

Did they have another kid?” asked one stumped fan.</p><p>Another asked: “Wait, who’s birthday is it?”</p><p>To make things completely clear, his full legal birth name is Willard Carroll Smith Jr.</p><p>Related Topics</p><p>MORE CELEBRITY STORIES</p><span></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuwaqwwaKrZ5ufonxzfJFsZmlxX2eEcMPIpaNmq52ewal5xZqlrGWcpMCmedOhnKKqXaK2r7DSZpifrJWnequtw5pknJmcocButMimZJuxXZ22tHnRnpilZZ6WuqZ7</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 DashJ - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
