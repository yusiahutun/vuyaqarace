Here are the best spots</p><p class=dcr-1fp5gi9>Modern life has almost eradicated mass uprisings of cheer – almost, but not quite, as there’s nothing like a group roar into a freezing sea to remind us that life is good.</p><p class=dcr-1fp5gi9>Communal swims have a slightly different feel depending on the day they take place – <a href=# data-link-name="in body link" data-component=auto-linked-tag>Christmas</a> Day swims are a rare chance to commune with your tribe (which may be different from your actual family) and may inspire a little joy for the rest of the day. Boxing Day swims can be a purification after all the indulgence. And charging in on New Year’s Day is a good way to embrace the year ahead.</p><p class=dcr-1fp5gi9>When I am not near enough to join a big swim, I still find somewhere for a dunk on at least one of the days. It’s not the same as thrashing about in the midst of a happy group, but it’s still one big, cold joyful shot in the arm (and buttocks, and legs).</p><p class=dcr-1fp5gi9>Cautions apply: cold water raises blood pressure and leads to gasping, and carries risks including heart, asthma and panic attacks, and hypothermia. Winter swimming should not be undertaken under the influence or hungover. The beauty of these swims <strong>–</strong> some of which have been going for more than 100 years <strong>–</strong> is that they are still holding on to their spontaneous everybody-go-for-it nature and safety light touch. Help them preserve this informality through the current winter swimming explosion by managing your own risk. Check the process before setting off – some swims require online registrations and ask for £10 plus for local charities.</p><h2 id=northern-england><strong>Northern England</strong></h2><p class=dcr-1fp5gi9><strong>Pier Road, Whitby, from 10am on Boxing Day<br></strong>Fun, frantic and 48 years old, this is a local tradition for families meeting up to spend Boxing Day morning together. It was last held in 2021, where230 swimmers dashed into the ice-cold North Sea. Swimmers in the north-east can also attend Boxing Day dips at Hartlepool, Redcar and Sunderland, while in the north-west, there’s a modern organised swim at Salford Quays (£25, with tow floats).<a href=# data-link-name="in body link"><br></a><a href=# data-link-name="in body link">Whitby Lions Boxing Day dip</a>, £10</p><h2 id=east-england><strong>East England</strong></h2><p class=dcr-1fp5gi9><strong>Cromer beach, from 10am on Boxing Day</strong></p><figure id=1c96c09e-eab8-4113-9afc-44edfebe8c6c data-spacefinder-role=inline data-spacefinder-type=model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement class=dcr-173mewl><span class=dcr-1inf02i></span><span class=dcr-1qvd3m6>Cromer’s ‘glorious spectacle’.</span> Photograph: Barbara Cook/Alamy</figure><p class=dcr-1fp5gi9>What started with a few runners going for a Boxing Day run then carrying on into the sea 30 years ago has grown into “a glorious spectacle watched by thousands”, says current organiser Clive Hedges.</p><p class=dcr-1fp5gi9>The dip starts with a fun run, then 45 minutes later there’s a dip, watched by spectators lining the promenade and Cromer pier.</p><p class=dcr-1fp5gi9>“Everyone is high on the spirit of Christmas or life,” says Hedges. Fancy dress is a small part of it but “nobody can dress up over a wetsuit: wetsuits are not in the spirit of it at all”, he adds. Bring money for the collection buckets and if possible wear trainers for the swim. The beach runs from sand to pebbles so you’ll need them to get back to your clothes.</p><p class=dcr-1fp5gi9>Other big swims in the area include Felixstowe and Hunstanton on Christmas Day, and Gorleston and Southend on New Year’s Day (£25 for the latter).<a href=# data-link-name="in body link"><br></a><a href=# data-link-name="in body link">North Norfolk Beach Runners Boxing Day dip</a>, free</p><h2 id=south-east><strong>South</strong><strong>-east</strong></h2><p class=dcr-1fp5gi9><strong>Sunny Sands beach</strong><strong>, </strong><strong>Folkestone</strong><strong>,</strong><strong> from 9.30am on Boxing Day</strong><strong><br></strong>There’s a three-minute maximum immersion time at the Folkestone Boxing Day dip, with fundraising for the charity of your choice.

The tradition began in 1891; YEABA members used to bathe every day except the Sabbath in the River Tay, and on occasion ice has had to be smashed.
