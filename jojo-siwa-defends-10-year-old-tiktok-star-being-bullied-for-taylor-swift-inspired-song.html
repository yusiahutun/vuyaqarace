Are you 22? Made you shake it off but look at what you made me do.” However, it seems like the internet doesn’t approve of the new track, but <a href=#>JoJo Siwa</a> definitely does.</p><figure class="wp-block-grvmedia-grv-video GRVMultiVideo"></figure><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.celebritytidbit.com/uploads/39/2023/09/GettyImages-1433022510-683x1024.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-jojo-siwa-defends-everleigh-rose-from-online-bullies>JoJo Siwa defends Everleigh Rose from online ‘bullies’</h2><p>Taking to her own <a href=#>TikTok</a> account, The Dance Moms alum, who recently debuted her <a href=#>‘stunning’ hair transformation</a>, posted a video of herself singing and dancing along to the song in her car, as she wrote above the video:</p><p>“To anyone who has said anything negative about this song…. you need to calm down. (Read Caption)”. The lengthy caption read:</p><p>“Saying all of this with love… As the now 20-year-old who once was the 10-year-old growing up in front of the internet, I wanna say to anyone that’s been saying negative things about this song or Everleigh herself, lose your ego and grow up…</p><p>“First, this song is adorable (and insanely catchy). And second… Bullying isn’t cool, it’s not funny, and it’s not trendy, ever… especially when it’s directed at a 10-year-old and her first song by people much older than her,” she continued.</p><p>“Some even adults. If you’ve posted something knocking this, you should be embarrassed. I also without a doubt can say that Everleigh is one of the kindest and hardest-working kids I’ve ever had the joy of getting to be around and she absolutely deserves all the love and success she has,” the 20-year-old concluded.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-fans-praise-jojo-s-growth>Fans praise JoJo’s ‘growth’</h2><p>JoJo’s followers took to the comments to praise the star on her ‘growth’ since being in the industry.</p><p>“The caption!

I’ve had this song stuck in my head all day, super fun,” said another.</p><p>“I’m so happy kids have you to look up to JoJo,” praised one Siwa fan.</p><p>Everleigh and JoJo go way back as they’ve done a number of YouTube collaborations together, as well as the 10-year-old starring in one of Siwa’s <a href=#>music</a> videos.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-everleigh-s-father-tragically-passed-away-earlier-this-year>Everleigh’s father tragically passed away earlier this year</h2><p>The young YouTube star tragically lost her father Tommy Smith earlier this year.
