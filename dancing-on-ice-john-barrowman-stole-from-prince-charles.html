While appearing on back in 2018, he revealed that he was once caught red-handed after stealing from Prince Charles' home. What's more, the future King had a hilarious reaction to the situation. Having been invited to do a private performance at his country home, Highgrove House, John couldn’t resist sneaking away two of the royal's champagne flutes. He said: "On the way out I took two champagne flutes. I got my friend to put one under the seat and told her no one would know." However, Charles was quick to spot that they were missing.

I mean, who wouldn’t take a glass if you are doing that, right? Don’t tell anybody or they won't have me back!" Since his appearance on , John has gone on to enjoy plenty of new career opportunities, and is very much enjoying his first year working on, alongside hosts Holly Willoughby and Phillip Schofield, and fellow judges Ashley Banjo, Jayne Torvil and Christopher Dean. The star has replaced Jason Gardiner, who quit the programme last year.&nbsp;</p><p id=eaOpJG_sPclS data-wc=1><strong>MORE:</strong> <a class=hm-link href=#>You can now go on Safari at the Queen's Balmoral estate</a></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/2d375b04df33-prince-charles-john-barrowman-z.jpg><p style=text-align:center id=eMg96wEn7WuD data-wc=5><strong>Prince Charles' reaction was hilarious&nbsp;</strong></p><p id=eK-YoeZhHEjX data-wc=84>On joining , John said: "I am so excited to be returning to the family. Unlike most I have been through the rigorous task of skating live as a contestant in the first series. This is a thrilling adventure for me and I hope to bring a Fresh, Fun and Fab-u-lous angle to the judging panel." The star is no stranger to the ITV skating show, having participated in it back in 2006, where he finished in fourth place.&nbsp;</p><p id=e314U6j1sRU8 data-wc=14></p><h2 class="newsletterTitleClass_nlzr60o hm-heading">Sign up to HELLO Daily! for the best royal, celebrity and lifestyle coverage</h2><span class=newsletterDisclaimerClass_ncg5smk><p>By entering your details, you are agreeing to HELLO!
