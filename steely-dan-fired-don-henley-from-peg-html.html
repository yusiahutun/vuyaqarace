He came in and they tried it — and it might as well have been me and you,” Katz recalled. “They tried&nbsp;a second time and got the same disappointing result. There wasn’t patience as much as instant reaction of the realities of the moment. We didn’t jerk people off by letting them think it was going to work and have them sit for two hours. When we knew it wasn’t going to be okay, Fagen would tell me to end it. So they sang it again, and it was no good.” As part of the band’s inner circle during the Aja sessions, Katz had to tell Henley and Larson that their services were no longer needed. Fagen and Becker excused themselves to “go get a sandwich” out of the studio, which is when the duo told Katz to “<a href=#>fire them</a>.” <a href=#>Michael McDonald</a>, of course, ended up stepping in and annihilating the vocals, while Fagen and Becker turned their attention to <a href=#>psychologically destroying the welfare of studio musicians</a> to nail the guitar solo. Yes, it was worth it.</p><h2 class=related-title data-editable=title>Related</h2><ul class=related-links data-editable=relatedItems><li class=related-link><span class=svg-wrapper></span><a href=# data-track-type=article-link data-track-component-name=related data-track-page-uri=www.vulture.com/_pages/ckk5yx1di0000y3ormtbeaz0h@published data-track-headline data-track-component-title=Related><span class=headline>The Greatest and Yacht-iest of the Doobie Brothers, As Told by Michael McDonald</span></a></li></ul><span class=ambrose-short-hed>Don Henley Also Had the Honor of Being Fired by Steely Dan</span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7t8HLrayrnV6YvK57kWlpa2dgZny0wMSeo7JllJa7brLIq5ydZZSku260xKejnrFdm7%2BwuYypnKBmmKm6rQ%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 DashJ - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
