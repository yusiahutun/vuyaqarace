Stories and posts in the feeds of celebrities, influencers and even regular users are filled with filters – filters that change users’ faces and features to make them ‘more attractive’. Swollen lips, thin noses, flawless skin and much more. But on TikTok, the revolution is on its way with #filtersareunhealthy.</p><h2>Say goodbye to the filters that screw up our self-esteem</h2><p>The photos and videos we see every day on social media do not reflect the truth and cause many problems in the mental health of young people who are constantly exposed to unrealistic beauty standards.</p><p>In recent years, cosmetic surgeons have even observed the birth of a new phenomenon called “Snapchat dysmorphia.” More and more new clients are bringing their filtered selfies to consultations, hoping to look like their ‘beautified’ versions after the operation.</p><p>According to a Wall Street Journal article, social media has a significant impact on teenage girls’ mental health. The researchers reported in their study that thirty-two per cent of teen girls said that when they felt bad about their bodies, Instagram made them feel worse.</p><p>To resist and change all this, a new trend is coming in TikTok. Users of one of the most popular social media at the moment refuse to use filters and present themselves as they are.</p><a title=@charlidamelio href=# rel=noopener>@charlidamelio</a><a title="♬ Tear in My Heart - twenty one pilots" href=# rel=noopener>♬ Tear in My Heart – twenty one pilots</a><p>The anti-beauty filter trend is accompanied by the song&nbsp;“Tear in my heart” by Twenty One Pilots. The lyrics say: “The songs on the radio are okay / but my taste in music is your face” – appropriately, numerous users first show themselves with beauty filters before they proudly present their true colors.</p><a title=@kellybaums href=# rel=noopener>@kellybaums</a> What should be normalized next? <a title=filtersareunhealthy href=# rel=noopener>#filtersareunhealthy</a> <a title=filtersaredangerous href=# rel=noopener>#filtersaredangerous</a> <a title="♬ Tear in My Heart - twenty one pilots" href=# rel=noopener>♬ Tear in My Heart – twenty one pilots</a><h2>“Healthiest challenge ever on TikTok”</h2><p>The statement of the trend is clear and sends a positive message to teenagers: beauty filters are okay if you feel like it, but we still look best the way we really are.</p><p>The message seems to be well received: Numerous videos that pick up on the trend keep getting millions of views and likes.</p><p>A user writes: “This is the healthiest challenge that has ever existed on TikTok.”</p><a title=@_scrambledmeggs href=# rel=noopener>@_scrambledmeggs</a> Tiktok filters are ok.. <a title=filtersareunhealthy href=# rel=noopener>#filtersareunhealthy</a> <a title=trending href=# rel=noopener>#trending</a> <a title=foryou href=# rel=noopener>#foryou</a> <a title=fypシ href=# rel=noopener>#fypシ</a> <a title="♬ Tear in My Heart - twenty one pilots" href=# rel=noopener>♬ Tear in My Heart – twenty one pilots</a><p>Beyond being a trend, this is a statement from a new generation that is truly seeking change in the standards of beauty and the value society places on physical appearance. Hopefully, the next generation will be able to feel more comfortable in their own skin and realize that they are valuable for things beyond physicality.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmihnpu5sMPNnquwp6Kge6S7zGiqoaelobFuw8Rmqq2noGLCtLXNoGSfoZypsrO%2FjK2fnmWepHqntcutnKtlpKeyr7CMqKVmrJmgwbC3jKyYsqtdqLxw</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 DashJ - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
