to the home to find it being robbed before trying to take a photo of the suspect - and being chased by a group of 15 men.</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>But a police report has now

she left the home for 10 minutes to walk the dog and when she returned, she saw a man walking out from behind a fence.</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>She asked him why he was there and he told her he was delivering firewood, the police report noted, and left.</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>Miller, who had forgotten to lock the door behind her when she took out the dog, went into the house and 'felt that something was not right', according to the report, so left to take a photo of his car.</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>Outside, the suspect gave her a business card showing a tree service company before leaving, and Miller saw that he was driving a silver truck showing the name of a landscaping company.</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>But later that evening, her credit card company called her about fraudulent activity on her card and she checked her wallet and saw the card and $50 were missing, according to the report.</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>She had left the wallet out on a table inside the unlocked home while walking the dog.&nbsp;</span></p><p
