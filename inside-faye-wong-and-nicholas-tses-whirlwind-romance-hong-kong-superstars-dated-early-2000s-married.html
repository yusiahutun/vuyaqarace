Their undeniable connection was further evidenced when they were caught sharing a passionate kiss at a bar in Happy Valley, Hong Kong – but they continued to deny their romance.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-Topic class="css-1wyvcgo e1b1x8aa3"></span><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-Title class="css-i31uou e1b1x8aa1">Inside the luxury life of Hong Kong Cantopop diva Joey Yung</span></p></a></h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Months later, the lovebirds went to a pub in Causeway Bay to attend the celebration soirée of actor Tony Leung Chiu-wai’s Cannes Film Festival win, per the same source. They confirmed their status as a couple when they left hand in hand, sparking a fan frenzy.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2023/06/07/46e1fd61-bc33-417e-8992-484044428a8a_90576c7f.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">However, their romantic tale took a detour when they separated after two years as Tse got closer to Hong Kong actress Cecilia Cheung after they shot several films together. In 2005, Wong married Chinese actor Li Yapeng and they welcomed a daughter into their lives. Similarly, Tse exchanged vows with Cheung at Amanpulo Resort in 2006, and together they became parents to two sons.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><strong data-qa=ContentSchemaRender-defaultRenderMapFunctions-Component-0 class="css-1mniedq eq9i94316">Divorces, scandals and heartbreak</strong></h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2023/06/07/fdb3ef9e-ce48-49ea-902f-c83f85ae691a_5d8beeb1.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Despite their respective marriages, fate appeared to have other plans in store. In 2008, Tse and Cheung experienced a marital crisis when explicit photos of Cheung, along with other female stars, were leaked online as part of a major scandal in Hong Kong’s show business, as reported by The Straits Times. Tse stood by his wife through the turmoil – but called it quits in August 2011. They shared custody of their beloved sons, Lucas and Quintus.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-Topic class="css-1wyvcgo e1b1x8aa3"></span><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-Title class="css-i31uou e1b1x8aa1">Asia’s richest family gets bigger: Akash Ambani and Shloka Mehta’s baby joy</span></p></a></h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Then, in 2013, Wong and Li revealed that their marriage was coming to an end after nine years. Li shared that he had obtained custody of their daughter Yan as they navigated the difficult process of moving forward separately. However, while the exact cause of Wong and Li’s divorce remains undisclosed, financial issues are rumoured to have caused major issues in their household, per Singapore’s 8 Days.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2023/06/07/f509f191-c67c-4799-8528-075d287f8679_5f65d676.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Per the same source, a Chinese finance reporter referred to as “Zhang” said that after marrying Wong, Li embarked on various investment ventures including bars, properties and TV shows, but wasn’t successful in any of them. He accrued substantial debt instead, owing creditors US$5.6 million in debt, China Press reported in 2023.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Li seemingly confirmed the speculation during a 2018 appearance on the Chinese interview show A Date with Luyu, revealing a six-year period where he struggled without any income. He then confessed, “That’s why I got divorced.”</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-Topic class="css-1wyvcgo e1b1x8aa3"></span><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-Title class="css-i31uou e1b1x8aa1">Wong’s world: where are Hong Kong film icon Wong Kar-wai’s 6 muses now?</span></p></a></h3><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><strong data-qa=ContentSchemaRender-defaultRenderMapFunctions-Component-0 class="css-1mniedq eq9i94316">Where are their exes now?</strong></h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2023/06/07/d6cfe726-18c2-4057-aa77-d69fb7282e0b_dd4080e9.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">So what happened to Li and Cheung since their respective divorces?</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Cheung maintained a cordial relationship with her ex-husband Tse and took on the primary responsibility of raising their sons.
