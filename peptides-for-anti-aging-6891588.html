As it turns out, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>peptides</a> are much more than just a trending ingredient that will cycle out of popularity as quickly as it cycled in.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">But what are they exactly? How do we use them in our skincare? Do we actually need them? We turned to experts to answer all of your burning peptide questions.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-what-are-peptides></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_5-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>What Are Peptides?</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_6-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“Peptides are amino acids that act as building blocks for the skin," shares board-certified dermatologist <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Lian Mack</a>. "Another way to say it? Peptides are the smaller parts of the larger structural proteins in the skin.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_8-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Peptides not only occur naturally in our skin, but they are also a part of an even larger picture, as collagen is actually made up of three peptide chains (often called polypeptides), making peptides necessary for collagen production.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_10-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">We’re seeing peptides take a front seat in the anti-aging battle our skincare products are waging, because while collagen molecules are too large to absorb through our skin, peptides are not. That means that when we apply peptides to our faces, they can be absorbed past the outer layer of the skin and actually be used by our bodies. “Peptides act as signaling molecules, helping to boost collagen and elastin production,” explains Dr. Mack.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_12-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">There are many types of peptides, and the most popular ones you'll encounter are copper and collagen. According to <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Michelle Henry</a>, MD, board-certified dermatologist and Kiehl's consultant, copper peptides contain copper ions and are known for their wound-healing abilities as they assist in skin regeneration and repair. Collagen peptides promote collagen production to reduce the appearance of fine lines and firm skin.</p><p>You can add peptides to the list of important proteins that the body starts to produce less of after we hit 30 (along with collagen and elastin), which means our skin can use the helping hand of receiving additional peptides in the form of our skincare routine.</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_17-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Getty Images</p></span></figure><span class=heading-toc id=toc-benefit-of-peptides-for-skin></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_18-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Benefit of Peptides for Skin</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_19-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">There are many benefits to using peptides in your skincare routine. According to Dr. Henry, they include:</p><ul id=mntl-sc-block_21-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><li>Anti-aging properties</li><li>Hydration</li><li>Brightening effects</li><li>Wound-healing abilities</li><li>Anti-inflammatory properties</li><li>Firmness and elasticity</li><li>Better absorption of active ingredients</li></ul><p id=mntl-sc-block_23-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Peptides play well with others, which is why you can often find them in products alongside other active ingredients. Depending on what other ingredients they are paired with, peptides offer a host of benefits, including hydrating, firming, and tightening the skin. They can also help reduce the look of pores, diminish redness, ease inflammation, and help skin look plumper, therefore diminishing the look of wrinkles. “When peptides are formulated into skincare, those products improve tissue repair and cell turnover and help prevent and treat the overall signs of aging,” adds celebrity esthetician <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Sarah Akram</a>,</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_27-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">According to Dr. Henry, peptides are suitable for a wide range of individuals looking to address specific skin concerns. "They can be particularly beneficial for those seeking to improve the appearance of aging skin, enhance firmness, and promote a more youthful complexion," she says. "Peptides can also be used to target other concerns such as hydration, brightening, and skin repair."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_29-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Dendy&nbsp;Engelman</a>,&nbsp;MD, FACMS, FAAD, is a board-certified dermatologist and Mohs surgeon at the Shafer Clinic, agrees and adds that peptides can be especially helpful to those with sensitive skin conditions, such as <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>eczema</a> and <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=3>rosacea</a>.<br></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_31-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Both Akram and Dr. Mack recommend that everyone over the age of 30 incorporate peptides into their skincare routine. “Peptides are a valued anti-aging ingredient, so it’s important to incorporate peptides into your skincare regimen in your early 30s,” says Akram. "Using peptides in a nightly skincare routine helps the skin repair itself from environmental stressors encountered during the day and function to slow down the gaining process,” adds Dr. Mack.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-product-recommendations></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_33-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Product Recommendations</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_34-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Dr. Mack recommends her patients use <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>Monat Rewind Age Control Nectar</a>, which contains a cocktail of active ingredients including peptides, AHAs and hyaluronic acid to even skin tone and fight against fine lines and decreased elasticity. While Akram shares, “<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel=nofollow>Environ Tri-Peptide Complex+ Avance Elixir</a> keeps the skin firm and hydrated while working to maintain plumpness and improving the overall tone/appearance of skin.” Dr. Henry says that the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=3 rel=nofollow>Kiehl's Micro Dose Retinol Serum</a> will also firm skin and reduce the appearance of fine lines.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_36-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">We also love <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>Fleur & Bee Crème da la Cream Brightening Moisturizer</a>, which has peptides, vitamin C, hyaluronic acid, and squalane to plump and hydrate the skin, and if you’re looking to add peptides into your serum step, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel=nofollow>AMEŌN Aurora Glow Serum</a> contains a combination of five peptides as well as vitamins C and E and niacinamide and offers a serious glowy, pampering skincare experience.

Dr. Henry says that those with sensitive skin should be extra cautious as minor skin irritation could occur. So perform a patch test before using if you're unsure or are prone to irritation. Experts agree that those who are allergic to specific peptide ingredients should avoid using them. If you have underlying skin conditions or are undergoing medical treatments, Dr. Henry says to consult with a dermatologist before incorporating peptides into your routine.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-how-to-use-peptides-in-skincare></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_42-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>How to Use Peptides in Skincare</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_43-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Dr. Henry says that peptides can be mixed with many other skincare ingredients. You just have be mindful of a couple of things:</p><li>The first is compatibility. She says that some ingredients, such as certain acids or retinol, can affect peptides' stability or efficacy if used incorrectly. "Other hydrating ingredients like hyaluronic acid and<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1> niacinamide</a> work in tandem with peptides to enhance lipid barrier replenishment while regulating oil production," adds Dr. Engelman. "Antioxidants such as <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>vitamin C</a> can also be implemented to prevent environmental damage to the skin barrier and brighten uneven skin tone."&nbsp;</li><li>The second is the layering order. Dr. Henry recommends using peptides early in your routine to ensure they come into direct contact with your skin. Dr. Engelman says you can use them both during the day and night, or at least once a day. Apply a peptides-infused product on a clean face to ensure optimal absorption, and be sure not to overuse them so you don't get a reaction.<br></li><span class=heading-toc id=toc-frequently-asked-questions-91431309-efb1-493b-b123-f1a075c76023></span><h2 class=mntl-sc-block-universal-faq__title>Frequently Asked Questions</h2><ul id=mntl-sc-block-universal-faq__content_1-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block-universal-faq__content mntl-accordion js-accordion" readability=50><li class="accordion__item js-accordion-item is-active" data-ordinal=1 readability=-1><p><span class=accordion__title>Can peptides be combined with retinol?</span></p><p>Dr. Henry says yes!
