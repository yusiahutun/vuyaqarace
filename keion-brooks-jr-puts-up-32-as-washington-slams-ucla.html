The Huskies (16-13, 8-10 Pac-12) shot a blistering 15-for-24 (62.5 percent) from 3-point range with Brooks' 6-of-7 success leading the way. Moses Wood added four made 3-pointers on five attempts, part of his 18 points, as Washington used the long ball to build an insurmountable lead. UCLA (14-14, 9-8) took its third consecutive loss, while the Huskies won for the fourth time in six games. A late first-half stretch in which Washington's Sahvir Wheeler knocked down a shot from beyond the arc before Moses sank a pair turned a two-point Huskies lead into an 11-point edge. Washington's lead swelled to as many as 20 points in the second half. The Huskies shot 30-for-54 (55.6 percent) from the floor overall en route to posting the highest point total of any UCLA opponent this season. The Bruins came into the contest allowing just 64 points per game. Wheeler put a fitting cap on Washington's offensive deluge when he flung a desperation heave as the shot clock expired, banking in for the Huskies' final 3-pointer in the last minute. The basket completed an 11-point, 11-assist double-double for Wheeler. The Bruins made a comeback push midway through the second half, cutting an 18-point gap down to 12 over just 17 seconds. UCLA never got any closer, however. Lazar Stefanovic scored 22 points to lead the Bruins, and both Dylan Andrews and Adem Bona recorded double-doubles. Andrews scored 21 points and dished 11 assists, while Bona went for 16 points and 11 rebounds. No other Bruin scored more than six points. Beyond Stefanovic's 4-of-7 shooting from long range and a 2-of-3 effort from Sebastian Mack -- who scored all six of his points from outside -- the rest of the UCLA players went 1-for-12 from 3-point range. --Field Level Media</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rbHAnZyrZZOWua16wqikaKugpL%2B1v46nmK2hn6OurXvKnqCopl2Xv7C7yqxko6pdpcK1v4yup2ZrYmKutHnWmqqhoZ6cwbC6jKyjmqWjYsKkuMBomKusmZi5pquUn2xxbpZmr25%2Blp5nZm2Umn9uhZdvZ2ZskW6Do3%2FBcG%2Baa5VjtbW5yw%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 DashJ - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
