Now, a new pic of the besties has surfaced and it’s *chefs kiss*.</strong></p><p>Worldwide fame means the <a href=#>music</a> star can barely go anywhere without a storm of fans, and it looked like <a href=#>Sydney Zoo</a> provided a ‘safe haven’ for <a href=#>Taylor Swift</a> to hang out with <a href=#>Travis Kelce</a> and her pals. However, some Sydney residents were confused about her fondness of the location.</p><figure class="wp-block-grvmedia-grv-video GRVMultiVideo"></figure><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.celebritytidbit.com/uploads/39/2024/03/GettyImages-1677096751-683x1024.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-taylor-swift-fans-question-her-location-and-posture-with-sabrina-carpenter-at-sydney-zoo>Taylor Swift fans question her location and posture with Sabrina Carpenter at Sydney Zoo</h2><p>As the photo of the back of the two singers circulates the internet, fans gush over how it could be used as their joint album pic, should they ever create one. (We hope so).</p><p>Taylor Swift and <a href=#>Sabrina Carpenter</a> could be seen walking around the zoo and green scenery with comfy casual outfits on, as they enjoyed downtime from performing.</p><p>One of the first things fans noticed about the besties, was the noticeable height difference. Swift stands tall at 5’11, whereas Sabrina is tiny at just 5’0. A huge 11-inch difference! However with great height comes ‘not so great’ posture, apparently.</p><p>“Surprising how athletic Taylor has become for this tour yet her posture is still very much not great,” <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">wrote</a> one Reddit user.</p><p>However, Swifites had their faves’ back, as one responded, “As a woman about Taylor’s height: it just happens to us, man. Doesn’t help when we’re hanging out with our 5’0” friends either.”</p><p>“It’s the tall girl hunch,” responded another.</p><p>Others were questioning what was so good about the particular zoo, that Blank Space singer Taylor Swift was spending so much time there – first with Sabrina Carpenter and again with <a href=#>Travis Kelce</a>.</p><p>“I mean this genuinely – is there something special about the Sidney Zoo compared to other zoos around the world? It seems like that’s all she did in Australia lol,” questioned one.</p><p>However, others noted the 34-year-old probably has ‘limited places’ she can travel to, as one penned: “She definitely went out on the harbor. I’d say she’s limited in what she can do so her team select places that are quieter and that she is interested in.”</p><p>Another said it was strange how the media coverage was ‘wild’ that day she went to the zoo, much like how animals are watched behind glass.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-sabrina-thanks-taylor-for-eras-tour-whirlwind>Sabrina thanks Taylor for Eras Tour ‘whirlwind’</h2><p>As the On My Way singer’s time as an opener on the Eras Tour came to an end, she took to Instagram to thank the fans, and Taylor especially for her ‘magical time’.</p><p>Posting a carousel of pictures of herself on the huge stages, the singer, who is currently <a href=#>dating Barry Keoghan</a>, penned: “The most thank you’s I’ve ever thank you’d to Taylor. I feel so lucky to witness the magic that is you and this tour.</p><p>“There is truly no one like you and there never will be! I love you with all my heart and I will cherish this Taybrina era (and all the eras) till the end of time.”</p><p>Related Topics</p><p>MORE CELEBRITY STORIES</p><span></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuwaqwwaKrZ5ufonxzfJFtZmlrX2eEcMDAsqOoql2oxKqy02admqajYrCiutNmn56koGKvtsCMp6atoZOaeqmx0WaZmpxdpby0wNSrnGahnmK7psOMqZ%2BorJ9ivKd5x56pZpmemXq0rcGroKeZXZius7zEp6ueql2WwW7Ax55ks6efZA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 DashJ - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
