The American TV show centered around the services of Dr. Susan Kelleher, the lead veterinarian. The facility offers emergency services to exotic animals; all these covered in a thrilling documentary. Of late, however, one of the show’s popular faces has been missing, leading many to ask, what happened to Tom on Dr. K?</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/5ee35d196bbebf99.jpg><p class=align-left>The documentary is aired on Nat Geo Wild and is among the most entertaining reality shows. Its first episode was aired in October 2014 and has managed to amass a massive following ever since. Currently, at its <a href=# title="What happened to Tom on Dr. K" rel="nofollow noopener">eighth season</a>, the program has achieved great success. But as expected, it has its fair share of controversies.</p><p class=align-left>It is common to find new characters joining a particular show and others leaving at the same time. However, the show almost reached the cancellation level once after several former Dr. K Exotic Animal ER staff came up with several allegations against the project. One departure that was the least expected was that of a veterinary technician, Tom Cronenwett.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/4f18da9befdaee2d.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=29><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Jenny Jones murder updates, documentary, and lawsuit update</span></p></a><h2>What happened to Tom on Dr. K?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/4f18da9befdaee2d.jpg><p class=align-left>Many fans were shocked by the renowned vet’s departure from the series. He had been around for quite some time and had never shown any signs that he would exit soon. He had recently left the hospital, and on the 16th of June, 2018 Tom vented his feelings via a post on his Facebook page.</p><p class=align-left><strong>READ ALSO: </strong>Adrian Peterson net worth in 2020</p><p class=align-left>It read:</p>Very grateful for my job now!
