With that subject matter, you can bet that she has her fair share of steamy sex scenes.</p><p>In fact, she goes fully nude in next Sunday's episode, but she does have one item of clothing on ... a "merkin."</p><p>You feel "less naked," Olivia tells <strong><a href=#>Howard Stern</a></strong>. "People can't see as much. You're wearing a little fur bikini. ... I was walking around to the whole crew going, 'look at this!'"</p><p>"They fit you and they make it and they let you choose the consistency and the color," she continued. "It's huge. No one today is capable of wearing a '70s bush!"</p><p>Waiting for your permission to load Soundcloud audio.</p><p>Elsewhere in the interview, Howard also asks his guest if she ever missed out on a part because she was too beautiful.</p><p>"No, I don't think so," she says, before admitting she had been passed over for other reasons. "The funniest thing I heard recently was, I heard that I was 'too sophisticated' [for the part]. I thought, 'Oh, that sounds nice. I like that feedback. I didn't get the part but I'm a very sophisticated person. And then I found out later they actually said old."</p><p>The role in question was in <strong>"The Wolf of Wall Street."</strong> While the 32-year-old star never reveals which part she missed out on, we're guessing it was the role of <strong>Leonardo DiCaprio's</strong> onscreen wife Naomi. That part was ultimately played by <strong>Margot Robbie,</strong> who was in her early 20s when she filmed the flick.</p><p>"I thought she kicked so much ass in that movie," Wilde declares without naming names.</p><p>Olivia clearly isn't heartbroken about missing out on the role. "It shows that if you don't get something â€¦ it might lead to something else."</p><p>Gotta love her attitude!</p><p>Check out the clips to hear more from Olivia, and check her out in "Vinyl" on Sunday night on HBO.</p><p>Waiting for your permission to load Soundcloud audio.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmisn6Szoq6NnKamZ2Jlfnd7j2xmam1fpLmqwsiaZLChnJmybrnEq6Kipl2svK2yjKidZq%2BRobluv9OrnJ6sXZ28uK3RnWSsrJWnu3A%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 DashJ - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
