The first challenge required the contestants to make <strong>thirty-six savoury biscuits in two hours</strong>. The heat was on for the hopefuls as <a class=hm-link href=#>Paul Hollywood</a> and <a class=hm-link href=#>Mary Berry&nbsp;</a> asked for <strong>biscuits that were consistent in size, bake and colour</strong>.</p><p id=egfCH6Vo8On></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/aba3af75974e-team-z.jpg><p id=eE3aZMQwsqd data-wc=36><strong>"Itâ€™s got to be the best of its type</strong>," demanded Mary. Biscuit flavours ranged from <strong>Jordan's sough dough and chilli cheese biscuits to Luis' Spanish influenced-black olive and rosemary thins, to Iain's oatmeal and fig slices</strong>.</p><p id=eHYqntaflyU data-wc=61>As biscuits naturally don't require much kneading, the thickness of the bakes varied between the novice bakers. Martha, <strong>the youngest culinarian to have ever set foot in the Bake Off tent,&nbsp;</strong>decided to create quite the original biscuit sensation. The student challenged herself to make <strong>seventy-two biscuits to create her caramelised onion and goat's cheese sandwich biscuits</strong>, which impressed the judges.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/a4d279b94b88-martha-z.jpg><p id=eoFIqdnuPTQS data-wc=47>In the end it was Richard who succeeded once again in producing <strong>"flavoursome biscuits</strong><strong>"</strong> while Martha's sandwiches retained a <strong>"good snap</strong><strong>"</strong> according to Mary. However, Kate's shortbread parmesan and apple biscuits sadly failed to wow the judges and were deemed <strong>too soft, under-baked and lacked apple flavours</strong>.</p><p id=ex7zkEGofzie data-wc=44><strong>The second biscuit challenge required the bakers to produce eighteen Florentine wonders in one hour and fifteen minutes</strong>. Mary demanded the bakers to create <strong>chocolate-layered snaps with a lacy appearance, delicate biscuits with an even bake and covered in an even distribution of chocolate</strong>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/a653ef2a3851-marypaul-z.jpg><p id=eHBNVbROBiqU data-wc=108>In order to create the classic chocolate marking on the bottom of the Florentine, <strong>the chocolate must be tempered in order to avoid leaking through the bake&nbsp;</strong>- a task that challenged both Martha and Diana. Due to the high sugar content in the biscuits, it is easy to burn the bake which caused some trouble for the contestants including Iain, whose biscuits were over-baked. Ultimately, <strong>Richard won the technical challenge, creating beautiful "lacy, crisp, perfect" biscuits with a "good zig-zag" and a perfectly tempered chocolate layer</strong>, according to Mary. After a good night's rest, the bakers returned the next day, ready to face their <strong>3D show-stopper challenge</strong>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/5cf52567f8a1-richard-z.jpg><p id=exa3H9Z7S_al data-wc=15>Paul wanted "rigid but good tasting biscuits" while Mary asked for everything to be "homemade."</p><p id=e9aLumIzOm4i data-wc=32><strong>Enwezor decided to create eighty biscuits&nbsp;</strong>to construct his space adventure moon scene and self-proclaimed "super-duper spaceship" but <strong>his shop-bought fondant didn't go down well with the Queen of baking, Mary Berry</strong>.</p><p id=eZnTTXxcbuW data-wc=59>With <strong>Nancy's colourful Hansel and Gretel scene, Iain's Wild West creation and Martha's gigantic Ski village mountain scene</strong>, it is suffice to say that <strong>all the bakers were worthy of a blue peter badge in tonight's episode</strong>. Despite feeling at risk of leaving the tent, <strong>Iain surprised the judges with his sweet biscuits&nbsp;</strong>with a "good snap and crunch."</p><p id=eoyd45OWwbh data-wc=24>Meanwhile, <strong>Diana's train-themed bake was called "perfect" for Mary, while firm favourite, Richard, produced a sea-themed 3D sensation that was deemed 'genius'&nbsp;</strong>by Paul.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/51635601076d-richard-biscuit-z.jpg><p id=e3xcu_1lq9mx data-wc=27>In the end, <strong>Richard impressed the judges and was crowned this week's Star Baker while Enwezor sadly failed to impress Paul and Mary&nbsp;</strong>and was sent home.</p><p id=erRKr9wECCqU data-wc=22><strong>Episode three promises an evening of drama as the baking contestants must face 'Bread Week,' next Wednesday at 8pm on BBC One</strong>.</p><h2 class="newsletterTitleClass_nlzr60o hm-heading">Sign up to HELLO Daily! for the best royal, celebrity and lifestyle coverage</h2><span class=newsletterDisclaimerClass_ncg5smk><p>By entering your details, you are agreeing to HELLO!
