scene for a 15 rated film.”</p><p>Nominated for an Academy Award for her role in the movie, Natalie Portman said of the scene at the time: "Everyone was so worried about who was going to want to see this movie.</p><p>"I remember them being like, 'How do you get guys to a ballet movie? How do you get girls to a thriller? The answer is a lesbian scene. Everyone wants to see that," she told Entertainment Weekly.</p><h3>Cover girl</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i2-prod.dailystar.co.uk/incoming/article26551966.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_Kunis2JPG.jpg><p>Some of Mila's sexiest snaps ever have certainly come from her raunchy magazine photoshoots and her cover for GQ was no different.</p><p>Taking the cover spot to promote her comedy movie Friends With Benefits co-starring Justin Timberlake, the beauty posed up a storm as she flaunted her trim figure in a black two-piece.</p><p>The actress covered her modesty with a see-through beige top in the sizzling snap as she playfully smiled for the camera while biting down on the straw of her ice coffee cup.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i2-prod.dailystar.co.uk/incoming/article26551973.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_KuniaJPG.jpg><p>Another shot from the steamy shoot shows Mila sprawled out on the floor wearing a pink silk thong and a loose peach top and she showed off her perfect pins in a pair of sky high stilettos.</p><p>Despite her obvious good looks, the star admitted in the interview that image is not her priority.</p><p>She said: “Image is not a priority for me. A lot of times, people go into this industry with a grandiose idea of fame and think the only way to achieve that is to please everybody.</p><p>"Unfortunately, that can lead to very self-conscious on-screen choices.
