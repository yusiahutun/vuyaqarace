His directing resume is impressive as well, with Savage racking up consistent, solid work in the driver’s seat of episodes for series such as Zoey 101, That’s So Raven, Hannah Montana, Wizards of Waverly Place, 2 Broke Girls, Fresh Off the Boat, Black-ish, and Modern Family.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed-twitter wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter" id=emb-2 readability=2><p>https://twitter.com/danicamckellar/status/1093204714534195200</p></figure><p id=par-5_58>As for Saviano, the 44-year-old hasn’t continued acting. That’s because he decided to pursue a career as an attorney. Since 2015, he’s been <a href=#>managing start-up</a> celebrity brand consultancy Act 3 Advisors. He also dipped his toe back into acting between 2014 and 2016 with appearances on Law and Order: Special Victims Unit as, of course, an attorney.</p><p id=par-6_46>McKellar, meanwhile, has appeared throughout the years in television series including&nbsp;The West Wing,&nbsp;The Secret Life of the American Teenager,&nbsp;and&nbsp;How I Met Your Mother. She has also starred in Hallmark Channel movies including&nbsp;Love and Sunshine,&nbsp;Christmas at Grand Valley, two movies in the Matchmaker Series, and many more.</p><h2>How Danica McKellar’s parents came up with her name</h2><p id=par-7_35>The 45-year-old actress shared on her website her parents’ reasoning for naming her as they did. Although the name is well known now, when she was born in the 1970s, it was considered exotic.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed-instagram wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram" id=emb-3></figure><p id=par-8_30>“The name “Danica” (pronounced with the same inflection as “Monica” or “Erica”),” she explained, “comes from a book called Name Your Baby that my parents bought before I was born.”</p><p id=par-9_48>“The name seems to be natively found in Denmark and also in most Slavic countries (although in Slavic nations, it’s pronounced “Don’-eetz-sa”) and it means, “Morning Star.” That’s why I named my production company “Morning Starlight Productions, ” since I guess a morning star would “produce” morning starlight.”</p><h2>Danica McKellar’s ethnicity</h2><p id=par-10_22>The mother of one shared her ethnicity on her website, where a fan asked if the actress is of Asian descent.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed-instagram wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram" id=emb-4></figure><p id=par-11_61>“You’re not the first one to ask me this: I’ve been asked if I were Asian, Hawaiian, Greek, etc.,” she revealed. “The truth is, I’m a big mix of Western Europe. I’m mostly Portuguese (this is my mom’s side), via the Azores and Madeira Islands. These are both groups of islands in the Atlantic Ocean settled by the Portuguese in 1418.”</p><p id=par-12_50>“This means that my mom’s side is probably a fair mix of Portuguese and native Islander! On my dad’s side, I’m part Scottish (hence “McKellar”), and a little each of: German, Spanish, French, and Dutch. No Asian, I’m afraid. Although you should see baby pictures, I really do look Asian!”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLTEmqusoJWawW%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGTEqa3TZqCsZaSdsm7DzqebnqpdrrKivtJmqq2ZomKxorrInJhmpZOgsq24wKuqZp2knbuqr8itsGegpKK5cA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 DashJ - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
