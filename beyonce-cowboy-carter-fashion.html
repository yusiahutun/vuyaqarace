The new album is a wild rush of genre-breaking music, an epic trail ride through the artist’s brain, taking us on a journey across her history and musical influences and her beautiful-but-tricky relationship with it all. It’s about celebrating country music, but it’s also about taking it to task and reclaiming its roots within Black culture. To put out an album like this in a dark and divided election year in America is one of the most authentically personal political acts by any commercially successful artist over the last decade.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=1 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">At a time when you’re damned if you do and damned if you don’t, Beyoncé gave us the kitchen sink and said it all with a ten-gallon hat full of grit and grace. She did it as an act of defiance but also one of self-empowerment. As she said on Instagram on the day of the release, “The criticisms I faced when I first entered this genre forced me to propel past the limitations that were put on me. [This album] is a result of challenging myself and taking my time to bend and blend genres together to create this body of work.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=2 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Listening to Cowboy Carter over the weekend, I kept thinking about the fashion industry. I thought about how incredible it can be, how lucky I am to be a part of it, and how uplifting fashion is at its core. It’s a medium of pure creative expression, and it has the power to break boundaries and change our views of the familiar, much like Beyoncé is doing now and has done over the course of her career. But it also made me realize, especially in the midst of the cyclical creative-director musical chairs at some of the top luxury houses, that there are so many creative forces that could meaningfully change the game for the long term if they were actually given the space and resources to do so. There are corporate and retail constraints, those based on traditional models of seasonality and trends and gender that are becoming less and less marketable in a chaotic world and amongst consumers with vastly diverse tastes. When creative people are given creative license, then they can cultivate genius.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=4 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">It’s a formula that has proven to be successful in the past. Alessandro Michele, who was appointed to the top spot at Valentino last week, is a great example of someone who used his artistic liberty to cause a seismic shift when he was at the helm of Gucci. When Demna was able to do his thing at Balenciaga, he changed the way a generation dressed. Same with Virgil Abloh at Louis Vuitton. And Rick Owens—well, he’s built a hugely successful business, with a fan base nearly as rabid as the Beyhive. Jonathan Anderson and Matthieu Blazy have also made headway in leading with creativity over commercialism in the luxury space.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=5 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Back in the day, Azzedine Alaïa—much to the chagrin of industry leaders—would show his iconic collections on his own timeline, on his own terms. Let’s also not forget about everything Miuccia Prada has done independently, or Marc Jacobs revolutionizing accessories and inventing ready-to-wear at Louis Vuitton, or John Galliano’s reinvention of house codes at Christian Dior.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=6 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">There are also plenty of independent labels working towards more equity and sustainability and creative fortitude in fashion. But with no financial backing or pathways to success, none of them stand a chance against the big-box names, as excited as we all may be at their shows during Fashion Month.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=7 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Baby steps can only get us so far. Disruption and the embrace of authenticity, like the kind we’re experiencing with Cowboy Carter, are the key components of change, and right now, at least in the most visible realms of the market, they’re hard to find in fashion. Although it’s a field that's all about innovation, it is still, by and large, a risk-averse business.<br></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=8 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The messaging and placement of well-known brands, luxury and not, is still highly controlled. At a time when luxury brands are dealing with an uncertain economic landscape and sociopolitical chaos continues to swirl globally, fashion has, for the last two years, been in a kind of stasis where playing it safe—in terms of design vision, marketing, and hiring—has been the M.O. Challenging the status quo is not part of the bottom line. Fashion tends to look inward, while music and art look outward to reflect the culture. It’s what keeps fashion ping-ponging forward then backward, forward then backward. But nothing about the times we are in calls for safety.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=9 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Some might say Beyoncé, the person and the brand, is also controlled. She doesn’t give interviews; she works on her own timelines. But that’s just it—she controls herself. Phoebe Philo is a great example of a female designer who has branched out and is now marching to her own beat. (A $2,000 silk neck-brace pillow? Why the hell not?)</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=10 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">What if luxury fashion gave unexpected candidates more opportunities and gave the established creatives more space to control their own visions? As traditional retail models break down and e-commerce giants go under, this should be a ripe moment for business leaders to hand over more freedom and invest in their talent beyond the grant prizes and collaborations and iron-clad contracts.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=11 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">It’s true that there’s been a huge spike in interest in cowboy fashion because of Beyoncé and her celebrity. But it’s not just about country style—people are shopping because she’s inspired them to think outside the confines of race and genre. That’s fashion’s greatest power—to inspire—and there’s so much hope in that kind of creative influence, so long as the creatives themselves are given the chance to saddle up on their own and just go.</p><span class="css-1s9owpq ev8dhu51"><img data-dynamic-svg=true src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.harpersbazaar.com/_assets/design-tokens/harpersbazaar/static/images/logos/lettermark.934d28d.svg?primary=%2523000" data-testid=dynamic-svg-base height=100 width=100 alt=Lettermark style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></span><p>Brooke Bobb is the fashion news director at Harper’s Bazaar, working across print and digital platforms.
