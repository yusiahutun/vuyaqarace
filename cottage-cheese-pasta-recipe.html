Tender noodles coated in silky smooth sauce is simple yet always satisfies our creamy pasta cravings. And while there are multiple ways of preparing this dish, one that’s caught our eye recently uses cottage cheese in the sauce. The reason?

The typical recipe for cottage cheese Alfredo contains about <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">240 calories, 12 grams of fat, 12 grams of carbohydrates and 18 grams of protein</a> per 1 cup serving.</p><p>All that extra protein can do a lot for your health. “When you digest protein, your metabolism increases,” says <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Florence Comite, MD</a>, founder of the Center for Precision Medicine and Health. “Casein milk proteins are among the highest bioavailable protein sources we consume, making them perfect for those looking to lose weight.” Dr. Comite adds that casein-rich dairy like cottage cheese bulks up inside the stomach when consumed, giving the feeling of fullness.</p><p>Overall, cottage cheese pasta sauce is a great way to get this dairy’s perks while enjoying a hearty dish.
