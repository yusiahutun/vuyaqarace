The Hollywood stars showed bounds of affection for each other, while Michelle also seemed to confirm the <strong>end of her romance</strong> with model <a class=hm-link href=#>Cara Delevingne</a>. As the rays of sunshine poured down and the waves lapped the side of their boat, Zac, 26, and Michelle, 35, showered each other with kisses.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/ed9929f21c6e-zac-holiday1-z.jpg><p id=ee23Rk_ntUAE data-wc=13><strong>Michelle Rodriguez (second right) and Zac Efron (right) were on holiday in Sardinia</strong></p><p id=eSaYDN-gmJOC data-wc=102>The hot new couple were joining a group of friends for a summer jaunt, as guests of<strong> businessman Gianluca Vacchi</strong>. Zac and the Italian entrepreneur, who had been spotted doing weight training earlier on in the holiday, flaunted their muscles as they did backward flips off the boat. Sporty Michelle, who showed off her washboard abs in a black-and-white striped bikini, was on hand to capture the moment. The <a class=hm-link href=#>Fast & Furious actress</a> had her own moment to shine as she was hoisted up the mast to enjoy a view of Sardinia â€“ the island she has frequently called <strong>"beautiful" on Instagram</strong>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/35597ecff000-zac-holiday-z.jpg><p id=edu2vBew-RN5 data-wc=10><strong>Zac Efron and</strong> <strong>businessman Gianluca Vacchi jump off their boat</strong></p><p id=e2okxSbWKFFU data-wc=94>Zac and Michelle seemed to be having the time of their life, judging by their photos on social media. The pair's stay has focused around swimming, sunbathing, dancing, partying and relaxing on deck in the Mediterranean heat. The couple also performed a dance routine entitled "Autoironic" by Gianluca, which will have brought Zac back to his High School Musical days. Earlier this year the Neighbors actor was romantically <a class=hm-link href=#>linked to his co-star Halton Sage</a>, after they were spotted looking close at a basketball game. Zac was quick to brush off the rumours, saying that he wasn't "in the market".&nbsp;</p><p id=ev-v9QQTeVKT data-wc=11><strong>Michelle Rodriguez's ex-girlfriend Cara Delevingne&nbsp;shared a poignant photo on Instagram</strong></p><p id=ePxMFZDlSTfg data-wc=83>Michelle and Cara, meanwhile, were believed to have been dating for a few months and most recently spotted on <a class=hm-link href=#>holiday in Mexico</a> just before Easter. On the same day that photos of Michelle and Zac's heated romance were circulated online, the 21-year-old model shared a message photo on Instagram. "If you cannot find a good companion to walk with, walk alone, like an elephant roaming the jungle," read the note. "It is better to be alone than to be with those who will hinder your progress."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbHLpaammZeWx6q6xGeaqKVfmLKtscGroK2hlah8c3yQbWdwaGdmhniDl2ixmptdmrOzu81mpKKbmJq5rbGMq6adqpmcwqbGjKSgrKtdqK6zsMinoJpn</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 DashJ - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
