It's not something that bothers everyone, but it certainly does frustrate me.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/fbb1ca35.jpg> Chazz Mair / Review Geek<p>The Monoprice Harmony Capsule 200 is touted as a portable speaker that offers "<a href=# class="norewrite noskim" rel="sponsored nofollow">Big Sound in a Small Package</a>," but it's a very lenient usage of "small." Longways, the Harmony measures 88-inches, as mentioned before, and its shorter sides are 3.5- and 3.7-inches each.</p><p>It's by no means massive, but I can't imagine anyone describing it as small. Instead, the&nbsp;Harmony Capsule's cylindrical shape makes it a breeze to find space for---as long as you're not lugging it around. The speaker is on the heavier side of the portable speaker market.</p><p>Thankfully it's also sturdy and waterproofed at an IPX7 rating---which means you can hold this thing under a few feet (about 1-meter) of water and have it come out fine. Rain isn't a problem for this speaker.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>While the Harmony Capsule is portable, I wouldn't carry it around unless I had a destination in mind. In addition, the battery only lasts eight hours, and it charges slowly, making a nearby charger a necessity. Consider carrying a <a href=#>power bank</a> with you if you're planning to use the speaker for more than a few hours away from home.</p><p>The Harmony Capsule 200 comes equipped with both Bluetooth 5.0 (offering up to 32-feet of range) and a microSD slot---something that is a little on the rare side nowadays. It's nice to have as an alternative option, even if I didn't get much usage out of it.</p><p>The play, Bluetooth, and power buttons are all present on the front of the speaker. They're slightly recessed, but they feel decent and responsive, except for the odd volume sliders. I got used to these quickly enough, though. I would've preferred the volume buttons to follow suit with the others, but it's just a minor oddity.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=sound-middling-and-muddy>Sound: Middling and Muddy</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/8cb9009f.jpg> Chazz Mair / Review Geek<ul><li><strong>Driver Size: </strong>1x ø66mm, 2x ø52mm</li><li><strong>Amplifier Power: </strong>1x 18watts, 2x6 Watts</li><li><strong>Nominal Impedance:</strong> 4Ω</li><li><strong>Bluetooth Range:</strong> 32ft (9.75m)</li></ul><p>Like most speakers, the Monoprice Harmony Capsule 200 uses a V-shaped sound profile; lows and highs are emphasized while the middle ground is recessed. As a result, it produces that big bassy sound that many people tend to like.</p><p>But even for a $70 speaker, the Harmony Capsule's quality winds up sounding both muddy and tinny. It doesn't handle volume well when compared to other <a href=#>Bluetooth speakers</a>&nbsp;in the same price range, like the&nbsp;<a href=#>JBL Clip 4</a>. There's a good middle volume where it sounds decent enough, but if you go too high or too low, the quality takes a noticeable dive.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Apparently, it uses an automatic <a href=#>EQ (equalizer)</a>, but it's hard to test it. Regardless of genre or artist, I kept running into tinny highs and muddled middles.</p><p>Given that the price of this speaker is fairly low, I don't expect the sound to be outstanding, but it doesn't match the rest of the design. When I buy a speaker as large as the Harmony Capsule 200, I want it to be loud and clear.</p><p>You can pair two of these up together for stereo sound, and once again considering the low price tag, it's a lot less of a commitment here. &nbsp;Stereo does help the volume issue, but not so much the actual sound. People still sound like they're mumbling; just now, it's from two places instead of one.</p><h2 id=user-experience-it-just-works>User Experience: It Just Works</h2><ul><li><strong>Battery Type:</strong> 7.2V Lithium-Ion</li><li><strong>Charging Time:</strong> 3 Hours</li><li><strong>Playback time:</strong> 8 Hours</li><li><strong>microSD Card Capacity:</strong> 32GB</li></ul><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Setting up the Monoprice Harmony Capsule 200 was a breeze---you turn it on and connect it to whatever device you want. The battery and connection status is noted by a series of little LED dots near the bottom of the speaker, right beneath the power button. It's straightforward, and that's appreciated.</p><p>Along the same vein, it's very noticeable how little the speaker does. There are no external applications; everything you can do with the speaker is right there on it. If you plug in an aux cable, it will play music from that device. The same goes for a Micro SD card---though it will play tracks in the exact order that songs are in on the card; there is no shuffle option.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/b6d400fc.jpg> Chazz Mair / Review Geek <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The lack of a skip, repeat, or back button was frustrating, however, I could see it working wonders at parties. And while it doesn't have multi-point connection, it can take your calls for you. The quality isn't the best, so I would look <a href=#>elsewhere for a speakerphone.</a></p><p>But, with this being a $70 budget speaker, the issue I ran into the most was simply how large it is. The Harmony Capsule 200 doesn't do enough to warrant its size. It's a little too big to carry around comfortably and its eight-hour battery life means you'll always want to have a battery pack with you.</p><p>My speaker was plugged in almost 24/7 because it never charged very swiftly, either. Overall, it's a bit clunky and not strong enough to match its stature.</p><h2 id=monoprice-harmony-capsule-200-get-two-on-sale>Monoprice Harmony Capsule 200: Get Two on Sale</h2><p>The Monoprice Harmony Capsule 200 isn't a very competitive speaker. Even at its standard price of $70, I would suggest people seek out other options. However, given that its sibling, the <a href=# class="norewrite noskim" rel="sponsored nofollow">Monoprice Harmony Capsule 300</a> is out, the 200 will likely be on sale very often.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>If you can get this speaker for around $40, I'd pick up two of them because, while the speaker's not the strongest, stereo is still stereo.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/310d4707.png><h5 class=display-card-title>Monoprice Harmony Capsule 200 Portable Bluetooth Speaker</h5><p class=display-card-description></p><strong class=sub-title>Pros</strong><ul class=pro-list><li class=icon>Sturdy</li><li class=icon>Affordable</li></ul><strong class=sub-title>Cons</strong><ul class=con-list><li class=icon>Poor audio quality</li><li class=icon>Large</li><li class=icon>Small battery</li></ul><a href=# class="norewrite noskim" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow sponsored">See at Monoprice</a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbvWraagnZWge6S7zGhoanBmbIVwuc6npqmqmZiybrTAq6SopqlisKK80q6jnmViZX1ursuunK2nn6m1br%2FPnpiknaJiv6bCyJ6uaA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 DashJ - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
