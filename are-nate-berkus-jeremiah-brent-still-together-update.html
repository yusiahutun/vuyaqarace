And I remember thinking to myself, ‘Oh God, what is this? This is not what I thought it was,'” Jeremiah recalled during a February 2022 interview with </span><a href=#><i><span>People</span></i></a><span>. “There was something about him that, in his presence, I just felt so safe.”</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.closerweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Are-Nate-Berkus-Jeremiah-Brent-Still-Together-Update.jpg><p><span>Less than a year after their first meeting, Nate proposed to the TV personality while vacationing in Peru.

Though they didn’t win the competition, they had several important takeaways from working together on the house.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>“The best part I would say was we really pushed ourselves outside of our comfort zone,” Jeremiah revealed during a March 2021 interview with </span><a href=#><i><span>Entertainment Tonight</span></i></a><span>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>In addition to their stint on the competition series, the home designers landed a show called </span><i><span>The Nate & Jeremiah Home Project</span></i><span> in October 2021.
