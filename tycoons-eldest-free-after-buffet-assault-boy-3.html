Government psychiatric reports said Ms Ho suffered from schizophrenia which contributed significantly to the assault.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The magistrate said that any assault on a child was a serious offence and expressed his sympathy to the victim's father.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Chief Court Prosecutor Ernest Cheung Yan-ming said after the psychiatric assessment that 'it is not in the interests of justice to continue with the prosecution of a person who, in particular, is suffering from a mental disorder'. The Department of Justice believed the bond was appropriate despite reservations from the boy's father.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Ms Ho apologised yesterday to the boy and his family through her lawyer, Jonathan Midgley, who asked that the case be dismissed after she was charged on July 26.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The bond, which is not a conviction and does not constitute a criminal record, normally requires the defendant to maintain good behaviour for a specified period with other conditions.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">If Ms Ho breaches the conditions, the case will be called before the magistrate for re-sentencing.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">On the night of July 8 Ms Ho was dining alone in the Grand Hyatt Hotel's cafe and queued with the boy at the buffet. The boy accidentally bumped into her, causing her to fall to her knees and drop her food.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The boy apologised but Ms Ho suddenly stepped on his left foot, causing him to cry out. 'It's because he purposely tripped me so I stepped on him back,' Ms Ho told the father.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The boy was uninjured.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Ms Ho has been schizophrenic for over three years, causing a series of problems, and her family has sought daily supervision, the court heard.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tK%2FMqWWcp51krrPAyJyjnmdmZoN5hZJoq7Kbn6S7tHnEpZueq6Ris7OxxGaYn6yVp3qjwcWfnK1lkajAosHLrWSbp6ligA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 DashJ - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
