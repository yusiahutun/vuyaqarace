They had also admitted this in the report submitted,” Yeung said.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“I am asking the federation to work with the association to address the governance issues as soon as possible. They should discuss each of the problems in detail, and identify and implement proposals for improvements, as well as submit a report to the government as soon as possible.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2023/05/07/a16dd955-21fa-4290-8e58-4743224da82e_6e973a2f.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Yeung said the federation was responsible for overseeing the governance of affiliated and publicly funded associations and the government must ensure that taxpayers’ money was well spent.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The anthem blunder took place after a song linked to the 2019 anti-government protests in Hong Kong was played at the February event, with athletes signalling for the tune to be cut as soon as they realised it was the wrong track.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-TitleText class="css-66qo9a eeeqn932">Hong Kong sports federation says ice hockey body ‘inaccurate’ in anthem claims</span></p></a></h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The report, submitted by the federation in March, said Annie Kwan Yuen-yee, leader of the ice hockey team, did not follow up on a request to ask the event organiser to check the national anthem beforehand.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">But the association hit back in a written reply on Thursday that Kwan had made six attempts to give a USB drive with the national anthem to tournament staff, but in vain. The association said the relevant staff could not be located or the chief of competition refused to take the USB drive because he thought he already had a correct copy.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2023/05/07/2ec18cc9-29f6-4497-80f5-233aa0cef598_318850cd.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The federation rejected the association’s explanations, triggering a new round of arguments, with the association countering on Friday and Saturday.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Association chairman Mike Kan Yeung-kit said in a 2,000-word rebuke issued late on Friday night that he could “no longer stay silent” after witnessing how the federation’s honorary secretary general Edgar Yang Joe-tsi had handled the matter.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Kan accused Yang, also the commandant of the Hong Kong Auxiliary Police Force, of interrogating Kwan in a threatening manner, saying it was similar to how authorities behaved in the 1960s, instead of sorting out the incident with her. He also accused the federation’s chief of not respecting the athletes’ efforts on the ice.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-TitleText class="css-66qo9a eeeqn932">Hong Kong Ice Hockey Association accuses sports federation of ‘interrogation’</span></p></a></h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The federation has rejected all the accusations.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Minister Yeung on Sunday appealed to both sides to work together and seek resolutions for the sake of the sport and athletes.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“As sports associations use taxpayers’ money for operations, they have an important responsibility, their good governance is essential. Without it, the efforts of athletes will go to waste and the promotion of the sport will be hindered,” he warned.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Yeung added that the government supported the federation in getting to the bottom of the matter through investigations, while the association should be held accountable and had to cooperate.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-TitleText class="css-66qo9a eeeqn932">Anthem blunder: Hong Kong leader warns of ‘appropriate actions’ against sports officials</span></p></a></h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The fiasco was the latest in a string of similar blunders, including one at a rugby match between Hong Kong and South Korea last November, prompting the government to issue related protocols to every sports group in the city.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Under the guidelines, leaders of sports teams are required to hand over a hard copy of the anthem and a city flag to the event organiser with official confirmation before the game and a check at the venue.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Those who breach the rules risk sanctions, including suspension of National Sports Association membership and loss of subvention or funding from the government.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tK%2FMqWWcp51ku6bD0mifqKaXYriwusZop6ikmam2pL%2BOmqmtoZOhsnB%2FkWpwb29pZLWwusZmoqiml2K7osDIqKWapF2Wu7W0xKZkm6Slo7GmvoyepZ1loqTEbq3NnWSfp5OqwG61zKmpqK6VorKvwIysp6iqpKh6rrXNoqqtnaJixKK%2Bzaxka2Wnlr%2Bztc2g</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 DashJ - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
