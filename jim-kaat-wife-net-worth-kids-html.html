Kitty, is the record-holding MBL pitcher with 16 consecutive Golden Gloves wins, the highest ever by any player.</p><p>In addition, the Washington Senator's veteran baseball star has bagged three All-Star awards and was victorious in the 1982 World Series, making him one of the best left-handed pitchers that MLB has ever witnessed.&nbsp;</p><h2 id=Career+++Progression++Missing+Athletic+Scholarship+To+The+Hall+Of+Fame name=Career+++Progression++Missing+Athletic+Scholarship+To+The+Hall+Of+Fame>Career & Progression</h2><p>Since his early days, Jim Kaat was a baseball fanatic and knew how to retire hitter without hitting hard. But, sadly, his height didn't match the caliber, which resulted in him getting denied an athletic scholarship.&nbsp;</p><p>As a result, he pursued his high school from a nearby college in Michigan, Hope College. However, things changed swiftly after Kaat's height elevated to a towering 6 feet and 4 inches, earning him a workout invitation from Washington Senators. The Senators got impressed by the young gun and offered him a $4000 signing bonus. At the same time, he got a $24,000 offer from White Sox, but his dad advised him to deny the more considerable sum in exchange for starting his career from a major roster, Senators.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-603 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span><span data-ez-ph-id=603 style="text-align:center!important;min-width:300px;line-height:0;padding:0;width:728px;background-color:rgba(128,128,128,5%)!important;float:none!important;margin-top:15px!important;margin-left:auto!important;min-height:400px;max-width:728px;background:rgba(128,128,128,5%)!important;margin-right:auto!important;display:block!important;margin-bottom:15px!important;border:0 solid #ddd!important"></span></p><p>Later in 1962, when Jim was representing&nbsp;Minnesota Twins, he played a significant role in the team’s emergence to the top. Kaat also won his first Golden Glove award in the following year as the writers voted him as the best pitcher of the American Leagues. Furthermore, Kaat proved that he was the best pitcher in all leagues after taking his Golden Glove streak to 16, the highest by any pitcher!</p><p>Finally, in 1983, after achieving various milestones and defeating many on-field competitors, the pitching legend Kaat announced his retirement. Later in 2001, the dominant pitcher was inducted into the Minnesota Twins Hall Of Fame.&nbsp;</p><p>However, the baseball legend’s personal life is far more twisted and opposite to his professional life.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-604 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span><span data-ez-ph-id=604 style="background:rgba(128,128,128,5%)!important;background-color:rgba(128,128,128,5%)!important;margin-right:auto!important;margin-bottom:15px!important;min-height:400px;margin-left:auto!important;width:728px;min-width:300px;line-height:0;text-align:center!important;max-width:728px;padding:0;border:0 solid #ddd!important;float:none!important;margin-top:15px!important;display:block!important"></span></p><p></p><p>Jim Kaat&nbsp;on his team jersey, on-field MBL&nbsp;(Source: <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">The Philly Show</a>)</p><h2 id=Marriage+Timeline+++Married+Four+Times++ name=Marriage+Timeline+++Married+Four+Times++>Married Multiple Times?&nbsp;</h2><p>The baseball star has the most unstable and tragic married life than most of the celebrities out there. Kaat&nbsp;has been married four times in his lifetime, among which two of them ended up with divorce, while his third wife passed away in 2008 after 22 years of married life.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-605 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span><span data-ez-ph-id=605 style="margin-left:auto!important;display:block!important;text-align:center!important;width:728px;float:none!important;margin-bottom:15px!important;min-width:300px;line-height:0;max-width:728px;background:rgba(128,128,128,5%)!important;border:0 solid #ddd!important;margin-top:15px!important;margin-right:auto!important;min-height:400px;padding:0;background-color:rgba(128,128,128,5%)!important"></span></p><p>Jim got tied in a marital knot for the first time in 1959 with his first wife, Julie Anne Moore but unfortunately got divorced after 17 years of their marriage. The stroke of hard luck followed as his second marriage with Linda Jankowski turned out in vain.&nbsp;</p><p>The duo got married on the same year of Kaat's divorce and parted ways after nearly a decade of being together. However, the baseballer's marriage quest does not end here as he got married a year after he divorced his second wife.</p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-187></span><span data-ez-ph-id=187 style="background:rgba(128,128,128,5%)!important;border:0 solid #ddd!important;float:none!important;margin-top:15px!important;text-align:center!important;max-width:580px;line-height:0;width:580px;min-height:400px;margin-right:auto!important;margin-bottom:15px!important;margin-left:auto!important;min-width:580px;display:block!important;padding:0;background-color:rgba(128,128,128,5%)!important"></span><p>He married Marry Ann Montanaro in 1988, and the duo had four kids together. But, unfortunately, just when Kaat's marital vessel seemed to be on the right track, his family life got scattered again after he lost his wife in 2008.&nbsp;</p><p>After the death of his third wife, he got married to his present spouse, Margie Mather Bowes, on June 17, 2009. Currently,&nbsp;the baseball legend lives with his fourth wife, Margie, in Bennington, Vermont, Margie's&nbsp;hometown. &nbsp;</p><h2 id=A+Short+Bio+++Net+Worth name=A+Short+Bio+++Net+Worth>A Short Bio & Net Worth</h2><p>Jim Kaat was born on November 7, 1938, in Zeeland, Michigan, USA.
