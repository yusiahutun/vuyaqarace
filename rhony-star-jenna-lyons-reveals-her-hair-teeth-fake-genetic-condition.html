I paid a lot of money for them," Lyons said. "My hair is also fake. I can take it off. It's like a hat. It's not a wig."</p><p>"My eyelashes are fake. I have no eyebrows, and I also have scars all over my skin," she continued.</p><p>"So I was really conscious," Lyons added. "It's one of the reasons I went into fashion. I wanted to look better. I was constantly trying to find ways to fit in."</p><p>According to the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Cleveland Clinic</strong></a>, incontinentia pigmenti (IP) is a genetic disorder "with distinctive skin rashes and lesions seen at birth or within the first few weeks."</p><p>After struggling to find false eyelashes she liked for a long time, Lyons decided to create her own line, which is called Love Seen.</p><p>"When I was doing a lot of red carpets, I kept trying to find eyelashes that looked good, and they were just huge on me," she said. "I couldn't wear them."</p><p>"I remember talking to my makeup artist Troi Ollivierre, and I was going on Oprah's show actually, and Oprah walked into the green room," she recalled. "He looked at me, and he looked at her, and he's like, 'Get back in that chair. We're gonna put some lashes on you and get some extensions.'"</p><p>"Because she's got a presence, and I looked like a wet rat," Lyons joked, before sharing, "I couldn't find what I wanted, so I created a line of lashes that aren't as over-the-top."</p><p>Lyons is among the cast of the RHONY reboot. Season 14 also stars Sai De Silva, Ubah Hassan, Erin Dana Lichy, Jessel Taank and Brynn Whitfield. Lyons is also the first openly gay cast member to appear on the Bravo series.</p><p>Waiting for your permission to load the Instagram Media.</p><a id=gallery-link-70ac3eaf-351c-4f3b-b1fd-0c10974a3840 class="media-link gallery-block__link js-track-link js-click-gallery" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:gallery:70ac3eaf-351c-4f3b-b1fd-0c10974a3840 data-context='{"name":"gallery-block","section":"permalink"}' data-container-ref=toofab:article:9b223824-f9b1-431b-9668-e4fe4429f07e data-gallery-layout=carousel><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/b7/4by3/2023/07/17/b7a02fdc29594a3bb94ecfa2865a4dca_md.jpg width=825 height=618 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmisn6Szoq6NnKamZ2Jlf3R7j3Bma2hfp7Wwuthmqq2ZomK3prrNmmSlsZ%2BjwG6%2BxK%2BcmqSjYrWmvoyhmKKqXamypsDHZp2ao5VitKa6xK2gnGWTpLultdOipqdn</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 DashJ - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
