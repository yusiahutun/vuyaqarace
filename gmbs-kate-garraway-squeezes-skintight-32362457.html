The trio had been discussing the point and the reasoning for the pants, as there had been arguments over whether buying the pants really gave the confidence people wanted.</p><p>At the end of the show, the hosts brought on two people to debate whether buying the M&S pants were worth it. Whilst the guests were debating the need or the ethics of buying the underwear, Kate stood up from behind her desk and proceeded to put the pants on above her cyan-green suit.</p><p><b>READ MORE: <a data-content-type=news data-link-tracking=InArticle|Link href=#>Coleen Nolan promises to strip 'naked' for GMB host â€“ but on one condition</a></b></p><p><b>READ MORE:</b> <a data-content-type=news data-link-tracking=InArticle|Link href=#><b>Join the Daily Star Soaps WhatsApp for all the latest spoilers and exclusives</b></a></p><p>The presenter initially had some issues getting the pants on over her suit as it felt "alien" to put the underwear on over clothes.

After the initial struggle, it seemed that Garraway was thrilled to be able to wear the pants herself and see what the results of the pads were like on her.</p><p>However, things would end in disaster for Kate as she soon realised that she was, in fact, too wide to wear them comfortably. She eventually struggled to take them off at the end of the show and as a result, left them on for the remainder of the programme before cutting to Lorraine, which was hosted by Christine Lampard.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i2-prod.dailystar.co.uk/showbiz/article32350637.ece/ALTERNATES/s458/0_gmb.jpg><p>Kate's volunteering to wear the pants came after co-host Adil Ray was urged by his fellow presenters to don the tight-fit pants. After reading the headlines for the show, Charlotte Hawkins, 48, told the Lingo host that the audience wanted to see him take on the padded pants.</p><p>However, Adil was having none of it and shut the idea down, quipping: "It's not that kind of show!" Ray continued to question the entire purpose of the pants themselves, and wound himself up by believing people could be lying about their own bum size, which could be a potential dealbreaker in a relationship, according to him.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/s2-prod.mirror.co.uk/@trinitymirrordigital/chameleon-branding/publications/dailystar/img/logo-schema-dailystar.png><p>"If you met somebody and they had that on and you went, 'Ooh, nice bum!' and you're attracted to that," Adil explained, "and then the reality as you get into the relationship with them and you're just, 'Huh?' Oh god yeah, imagine it's your first time and dropping a bit of Marvin Gaye on, gonna take them and then WOAAAH, WHAT'S GOING ON HERE!?," he screamed.</p><p>Co-hosts Kate and Charlotte burst out into fits of laughter during Adil's rant, as they could not contain the hilarity they felt. As Garraway wiped tears from her face, she quipped: "This is all so escalating!"</p><p><i>Good Morning Britain airs every weekday at 6am on ITV1 and ITVX.</i></p><p><b><i>For more of the latest showbiz and TV news from the Daily Star, make sure you sign up for one of our newsletters here.</i></b></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pa3IpbCsrJGne6S7ja6iaKymZLSurtJmopqslWK0or7Rmq6asV2ovraxxLOcrGWjoLavwMign61lY2eAd36Tbm4%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 DashJ - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
