At this special Art Walk opening, all guests who purchase artwork at a participating Alliance Member Gallery will be entered to win an Ultimate Cultural Alliance Gift Basket, a value of more than $500, with two VIP tickets to the Alliance Cabaret Series show of their choice.</p><p>Before the exhibition’s debut, guests will enjoy an open air reception in the courtyard with music by Will Vaugn, while Alliance Art Guild members set up their wares for sale at pop-up shops. Rose Marie Diem, an accomplished Alliance artist who began her career as a courtroom sketch artist, will perform live courtroom sketches.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.stuartmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/141/2022/05/Huddle-Up-by-Lynn-Morgan-on-view-in-22Justice22-1024x1024.jpg><p>Alongside “Justice,” patrons have the opportunity to catch a first peak of “I’m Still Standing,” an exhibition created in collaboration with the Inner Truth Project. In the exhibition, survivors of sexual trauma and professional artists were paired together to create unique works of art from upcycled and recycled materials that tell the stories of strength, survival, and perseverance. Guests can also peruse “Transcendent” at the Ohana Group Gallery, and “From Treasured Lands” in the Alliance’s Downtown Gallery, a conservation and recycling exhibition.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.stuartmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/141/2022/05/Justice-Prevails-by-Glenda-Preston-on-view-in-Justice-723x1024.jpg><p>The Ultimate Gift Basket will feature art by Barbara Lyons, Donna Franklin, and Cathleen Sullivan; two VIP tickets to “This Will Be;” two tickets to the Film Series Kickoff; jewelry by Judy Coffman; and a wellness basket from Pure Goodness and health guru Muffy Charles.
