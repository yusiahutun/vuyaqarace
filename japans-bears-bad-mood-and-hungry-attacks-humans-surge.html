They are skinny, they are hungry and they are easily riled up,” said Kevin Short, a naturalist and former professor of cultural anthropology at Tokyo University of Information Sciences.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“At this time of the year, they are not keen to hang out with humans,” he told This Week in Asia.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The recent winter, however, had been particularly challenging, he said.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“Last autumn saw an almost total failure of the nut harvest, especially of beech nuts, and that is what the bears rely on to fatten themselves up just before they go into hibernation,” he said. “The crop was the worst that I can remember and a lot of bears went into hibernation without sufficient energy reserves to get them through the winter.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">As a result, they emerged relatively early, partly due to the warmer winter temperatures this year, and were also very hungry, Short said.</p><img data-qa=BaseImage-handleRenderImage-StyledImage src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/styles/wide_landscape/public/d8/video/thumbnail/2024/01/03/Japan-Dog-Bear-thumb-clean.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p data-qa=SCMPYoutubeVideoPreview-PreviewDuration class="css-dkee4u eaw92su1">03:57</p><p data-qa=SCMPYoutubeVideoPreview-PreviewTitle class="css-1ajvbe4 eaw92su2">Dogs ‘hunt’ for bears in Japan to protect them from human threats</p><p>Dogs ‘hunt’ for bears in Japan to protect them from human threats</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Humans typically encounter bears when they are hiking in the mountains or when they gather mountain vegetables. However, there have been more cases of bears approaching farms, villages and even the outskirts of towns and cities as they forage for food, Short said.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The more hungry they are, the more likely they are to take a chance on approaching residential districts, according to Short.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">A Hokkaido bear hunter told Short that bears “tend to be more aggressive in the spring”.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Short said: “They are hungry, and they are more motivated to defend their food supply. In the autumn, there is usually a far greater availability of food but in the spring they will respond aggressively if they perceive a threat to their food.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">In early April, a bear appeared close to a restaurant on the outskirts of Fukuchiyama City, in Kyoto prefecture. In another incident, a man in his 70s picking wild vegetables in the mountains of Iwate prefecture was attacked and injured.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-TitleText class="css-66qo9a eeeqn932">In Japan, ‘rare’ bear sightings spark alarm, rampage fears in remote communities</span></p></a></h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">With sightings and attacks increasing across Hokkaido recently, the prefectural government introduced a new system last year that grants permits to hunters to operate in mountain areas in the spring.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Brown bears had come under protection in the past after widespread hunting caused their numbers to plummet. But their population has doubled in recent years, national broadcaster NHK reported, forcing local authorities to allow large-scale hunting.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Efforts are also being made to educate the public on the steps they should take if they encounter a bear in certain areas.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">A series of 30-second infomercials on dealing with bears for anyone on foot, on a bicycle or in a car were broadcast by NHK last year.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Hifumi Tsuruga, a bear expert at the Hokkaido Research Organisation, said it is important to take precautions to avoid meeting bears but knowing what to do in a worst-case scenario is even more important.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/styles/wide_landscape/public/d8/video/thumbnail/2024/01/03/Japan-Dog-Bear-thumb-clean.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“The most important thing is to avoid an encounter, if at all possible,” he said. “Use a whistle and talk to the people you are with to tell the animals that you’re in the vicinity and give them a chance to evade. I would strongly recommend that anyone planning to be in an area that is a habitat for bears be in a group of more than two people.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Tsuruga also suggested carrying pepper spray and aiming at a bear’s eyes and sensitive nose in a confrontation.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“If you do see a bear, back away slowly but keep watching the bear,” he said. He also warned against running away from or turning one’s back on a bear as the animal’s instinct would be to give chase.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">If confronted by a bear with cubs, the best approach may be to lay face down and protect one’s neck, face and stomach from bites and scratches, Tsuruga said. Wait until the bear has left before escaping, he added.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tK%2FMqWWcp51kxKaxymaYrKGRZLWmrcutn2adnqu2s7vNppynrF%2BWv7W1wqWcaGtia31zgpFooZqokaPAbq7EmqmsZZKWsW65zqibZpmemXqpwc2gqbJlkanBoq%2FKrGShrZ2Wu7R50q6poJ0%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 DashJ - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
