"There's none of me."</p><p>"I just think if you don't want them to get out, don't take them in the first place," she added.</p><p>"Million Dollar Matchmaker" star Stanger agreed. "Here's the thing â€” if you leave nudes of you phone, your phone might get stolen if you are a celebrity, it might get hacked by Anonymous, so it's kind of not a smart move," she said. "Don't take naked pictures on your phone."</p><p>She did add, however, that there's "no right or wrong" here because the photos were stolen from a personal item.</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:d0c9e34d-1fec-5baa-ae54-2867929c6948 data-container-ref=toofab:article:cba968b4-0029-5197-9724-8b7a278886c0 data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=27><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/33/5by4/2019/01/29/3376c5f8b18354b9bca5f81670c934d0_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">Getty</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">Bella Thorne Lashes Out At Whoopi For Claiming Nude Photo Leak Was Her Own Fault</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><p>Bella decided to post the stolen pictures herself rather than play games with the hacker; however Stanger questioned her motives.</p><p>"She's probably got a lot more followers," she said. "Because everything you're doing is for followers, you're not doing it for the real reasons anymore. You're doing it because you're playing the fame game."</p><p>She scoffed: "And what is Bella Thorne doing lately? What movie or show is she on?"</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:2b8359b3-b1aa-5ef6-b3e0-304f4cd3cc60 data-container-ref=toofab:article:cba968b4-0029-5197-9724-8b7a278886c0 data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=27><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/54/5by4/2019/06/06/54f0033070e85bcd84aa4fff27b03696_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">Getty/Instagram</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">Bella Thorne Helps Fan Come Out With a Kiss at LA Pride Event</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><p>Stanger also dismissed the idea that the divide of opinion was a generational matter: "Are you kidding? Don't have nudes if you're 18 or 80. And if you're 80 PLEASE don't. It's really ugly."</p><p>That final point <a href=#><strong>Suzanne Somers</strong></a> disagreed on. When asked about the fallout, the "Three's Company" star joked: "I wanna see Whoopi naked," adding she would bet money Goldberg had taken nudes before.</p><p>However the 72-year-old said she wouldn't hold out hope for Whoopi apologizing to Bella any time soon. "Whoopi marches to her own drummer," she laughed.</p><p><strong>Got a story or a tip for us?
