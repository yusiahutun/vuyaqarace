However, if there’s one thing about <a href=#>Rihanna</a>, she’s not keeping any hairstyle very long, as she admits she’s “already over” the blonde look. Well, this style was a great send off…</p><figure class="wp-block-grvmedia-grv-video GRVMultiVideo"></figure><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.celebritytidbit.com/uploads/39/2024/04/GettyImages-2150388259-780x1024.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-rihanna-stuns-with-long-blonde-hair-but-she-s-already-over-it>Rihanna stuns with long blonde hair – but she’s already ‘over it’</h2><p>Taking to the “golden carpet” the mom of two stunned in a sand-colored low-cut dress, showing off all her curves.

I get bored, and I need to move on to something, or I’m going to crawl out of my body,” before later adding she was “over it anyway.”</p><p>“Tomorrow, I’m not going to have this hairstyle and my hairstylist is going to be mad about it.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-the-star-continues-to-fangirl-over-bravo>The star continues to fangirl over Bravo</h2><p>One thing we just learnt about Rihanna, is her love for reality TV, especially Bravo. Who knew the singer was a coach potato just like us?</p><p>At her most recent event, she joked she wanted to “stop the interview” as the reporter told her she hadn’t seen any of the shows.</p><p>She then went on to give her expert advice, telling the interviewer to start with Vanderpump Rules, and then ‘putting the Housewives series into a hat’ before picking which one to watch.</p><p>“I feel like Andy needs to pay me at this point bro!” she jokingly exclaims after her deep analysis of the shows.
